Saint Roch Interceding with the Virgin for the Plague-Stricken is an early religious painting by the French artist Jacques-Louis David. It shows Saint Roch interceding to the Virgin Mary and Christ Child for the plague sufferers shown around him. He painted it in 1780 during his stay at the Villa Medici in Rome after winning first prize for painting in the Prix de Rome (before his Portrait of count Stanislas Potocki) and exhibited it at the 1781 Paris Salon on his return to France. While in Rome he was much influenced by the works of Caravaggio, Poussin, Guercino and Lebrun. He was determined not to be seduced by the Italian baroque style, declaring ""the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move"". Nevertheless, he filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings while he was in Rome, and he and his studio used them as models for the rest of his life.[1][2]

Saint Roch is, among other things, the patron saint of invalids, and is specially invoked against the plague. Having recovered from the illness himself, he is portrayed as a pilgrim with a staff and a bubo on his thigh (a relic of his illness), and is often accompanied by a dog, representing the dog that brought him bread and licked his wounds when he was ill.[3]

In the painting, Saint Roch is in the middle on the right, looking up at the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child at top left. Saint Roch is recognisable from his pilgrim's attire, the bubo on his leg and the dog behind him. He is pleading to Mary for her intercession. To the bottom left is a tight-knit group of sufferers sitting and lying on the ground. Mary is dressed in bright blue and red robes and is playing with the Baby, seemingly indifferent to the plight of the men below. They are painted in sombre browns and greys, and their suffering is emphasized by a glimpse in the middle distance on the right of victims lying in a stupor and being carried away in a cart.[4]

The picture is an oil-on-canvas work measuring 260 by 195 cm (102 by 77 in). It is now in the Musée des beaux-arts de Marseille, France.[5]

The picture has been compared to, and may have been influenced by, Christ Appointing Saint Roch as Patron Saint of Plague Victims, a 1623-1626 altarpiece by Peter Paul Rubens. In Rubens's picture, the plague victims are hopeful, seeing Saint Roch and Christ above them as their saviours, about to cure them. David's victims on the other hand are apathetic, they see themselves as doomed; one gazes at the viewer in silent reproach, another makes a frantic movement that seems to lack purpose, and a third looks up at Saint Roch and the Virgin Mary with closed eyes.  Even Saint Roch and the Virgin Mary appear unconnected as if separated by a glass screen. He looks up and pleads with her but their hands do not touch; she seems unaware of his presence and is gesturing towards something in the middle distance.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5454994,"Fishing (or Fishing Scene) is a painting by Italian artist Annibale Carracci, painted before 1595 and given to Louis XIV by Prince Camillo Pamphili in 1665.  It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris.

The painting and its companion, Hunting, were included in Charles Le Brun's inventory in 1683, and in November 1695 they were in the apartments of King Louis XIV's younger brother. It was no doubt for this purpose that they were given two sumptuous gilt frames, each with attributes suited to the subject of the painting - among the finest examples of the art of frame-making in the time of Louis XIV. In 1955, when the varnish was being cleaned, the 19th century gilding covering the original gilding was removed - a task of some magnitude which was carried out by the French firm of Lebrun.[1]

This work, together with its companion, date from Carracci's Bolognese period, before he left for Rome in 1595 to paint at the Galleria Farnese. At this time he was extremely interested in landscape, and his experiments are a foreshadowing of Poussin's classical compositions; but in these pictures he is exploring in a different direction, in the tradition of the Bassani, a family of painters whose studios continued to turn out landscapes which were prized all over Europe. His interest was the countryside. Without any religious theme as pretext, he painted two pure landscapes whose true subjects are the forest and the river, motivated by the themes of hunting and fishing. Therefore, Carracci was able to show nature animated with the life of the aristocracy and of ordinary people. The composition follows the visual device of division into compartments.[2]

Together with the Galleria Farnese, the two thematic paintings are Carracci's greatest masterpieces, and have always been much admired by artists. Manet found inspiration in the Fishing, and the Hunting has been copied by Matisse, Edvard Munch and Rouault.[3]

Bonaparte Crossing the Alps (sometimes called Napoleon Crossing the Alps, which is also the title of Jacques-Louis David's better-known version of the subject) is a 1848–1850[2] oil painting by French artist Paul Delaroche.[3][4] The painting depicts Napoleon Bonaparte leading his army through the Alps on a mule,[I] a journey Napoleon and his army of soldiers made in the spring of 1800[5] in an attempt to surprise the Austrian army in Italy.[6][7]
Several versions of this painting exist: in the Louvre- Lens and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, England. Queen Victoria owned a small version of it.[8]

The work was inspired by Jacques-Louis David's series of five paintings of Napoleon Crossing the Alps (1801–1805), which present a glorified vision of Napoleon ""calm on a spirited horse""[9] rather than a mule, crossing Great St. Bernard Pass. 

As part of his 1798 campaign during the French Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon prepared to invade and conquer Egypt, which was at the time a province of the Ottoman Empire.[10] Such a military action promised numerous benefits, including securing French trade interests, and inhibiting British access to India. By 1 July 1798, Napoleon had landed on the shores of Egypt.[11] After a lengthy chain of conflicts with heavy casualties, the campaign resulted in an Ottoman-British victory. Napoleon received news from France that Austrian forces had retaken Italy and he decided to return to Paris.[citation needed]

In order to regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a surprise assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force to be able to traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route.[12] He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.[13][14]

On 15 May 1800, Napoleon and his army of 40,000—not including the field artillery and baggage trains—(35,000 light artillery and infantry, 5,000 cavalry) began the arduous journey through the mountains.[15][16][17][II] During the five days spent traversing the pass, Napoleon's army consumed almost 22,000 bottles of wine, more than a tonne and a half of cheese, and around 800 kilograms of meat.[15]

After crossing the Alps, Napoleon commenced military operations against the Austrian army. Despite an inauspicious start to the campaign, the Austrian forces were driven back to Marengo after nearly a month. There, a large battle took place on 14 June, which resulted in the Austrian evacuation of Italy.[2]

Delaroche, who studied with Antoine-Jean Gros, a protege of David, was a popular French painter of portraits and grand subjects from history and the Bible.[18][19][20]

The Liverpool painting was commissioned by Arthur George, Third Earl of Onslow, after Delaroche and George reportedly visited the Louvre in Paris, where they saw David's version of the famous event. It had only recently been re-hung in the museum after a resurgence of interest in Napoleon, nearly 40 years after he was exiled.[IV] Agreeing that the painting was unrealistic, George, who owned a sizable collection of Napoleonic paraphernalia, commissioned Delaroche to create a more realistic depiction.[21] Elizabeth Foucart-Walker asserts that in fact the painting that hangs in the Louvre-Lens was produced first as it was already in America by 1850, when the Liverpool painting was produced. Stephen Bann suggests that Arthur George's meeting with Delaroche may have occurred, but Delaroche chose to produce two works that are almost identical and send one to America.[22]

Unconscious of the dreary wastes around, 

Of sleet that pierces with each fitful blast, 
The icy peaks, the rough and treacherous ground, 
Huge snow-drifts by the whirlwind's breath amassed, 
Through which the jaded mule with noiseless tread, 
Patient and slow, a certain foothold seeks, 
By the old peasant-guide so meekly led; 
Moves the wan conqueror, with sunken cheeks, 
O'er heights as cold and lonely as his soul,- 
The chill lips blandly set, and the dark eyes 
Intent with fierce ambition's vast control, 
Sad, keen and thoughtful of the distant prize; 
With the imperial robes and warlike steed, 


That face ne'er wore such blended might and need![23]
The work, despite its attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several authorities for a variety of reasons. A few disapproved of Delaroche's choice of painting, while others disapproved of Delaroche himself, saying, in some form, that he sought the genius of Napoleon, to no avail.[24]

Soon after its completion, the work was taken to England, and there, in 1850, it was reviewed by the critic of the Atheneum,[VI] a literary magazine.[25] The magazine's comments on the work indicated that, while they praised the painting for several of its features, they criticised Delaroche, for various reasons:

An Officer in a French costume, mounted on a mule, is conducted by a rough peasant through a dangerous pass, whose traces are scarcely discernible through the deep-lying snow; and his aide-de-camp is just visible in a ravine of the towering Alps. These facts are rendered with a fidelity that has not omitted the plait of a drapery, the shaggy texture of the four-footed animal, nor a detail of the harness on his back. The drifting of the embedded snow, the pendent icicle which a solitary sun-ray in a transient moment has made-all are given with a truth which will be dear to those who exalt the Dutch School for like qualities into the foremost rank of excellence. But the lofty and daring genius that led the humble Lieutenant of Ajaccio to be ruler and arbiter of the destinies of the larger part of Europe will be sought in vain by M. Delaroche.[24]
Some were displeased with Delaroche's work at the time in general, and, in part, Bonaparte Crossing the Alps, criticising what was described as his 'lowered standards in art'. Such critics included The Gentleman's Magazine, who wrote the following text about Delaroche:

These all reveal a modification in his style, but not a happy one. His more recent works are not calculated to restore him the sympathy he had lost. It must be confessed that Delaroche is an artist of talent rather than a genius. Education and diligent study qualified him to be a painter, but not an artist, in the true sense of that word. For he has failed in the true mission of the artist-that of advancing the education of the masses; when it was in his power to give an impulse, he yielded to it; he has been a reflection, but not a light; and instead of elevating the public to himself, he has lowered himself to the public.[26]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3208369,"Andromache Mourning Hector is a 1783 oil-on-canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jacques-Louis David. The painting depicts an image from Homer's Iliad, showing Andromache, comforted by her son, Astyanax, mourning over her husband Hector, who has been killed by Achilles.[1] This painting, presented on 23 August 1783, brought David election to the Académie Royale in 1784.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q14940548,"Young Girl in a Park is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Berthe Morisot, created between 1888 and 1893. It has the dimensions of 90 by 81 cm. It is held at the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse.[1]

This canvas, in an almost square format, is a portrait of a young girl named Jeanne-Marie, who also would pose for Julie Manet, the artist's daughter.[1] Morisot began this work in 1888 but quickly abandoned it. She waited until 1893 to return to it and complete it, two years before she died. In 1892, on the occasion of her personal exhibition, the work was not finished and couldn't be shown to the public. The model of the work can be found in several works by Berthe Morisot, including Young Girl Leaning (1887) and Young Woman with a Hat (1888). Jeanne-Marie began posing for this painting in 1888, but in 1893, when Morisot resumed work on it, she was no longer available. The artist decided to continue the work despite the absence of a model, drawing inspiration from her daughter, which explains the slightly fixed appearance of the young girl's face.

The young girl faces us, monumentalized by a frontal position. She is seated on a bench, in the foreground of the work, slightly off center to the right. The frame cuts it through her legs. She is surrounded by a lush garden and wears a large English hat in beige tones. Her wavy red hair falls over her shoulders framing a soft, fixed face, on which a smile is sketched. The curves drawn by the vegetation echo those of her body, underlined by the clothing, as well as the roundness of the hat and the undulation of her hair. Only the vertical and horizontal lines of the bench interrupt this intertwining of soft lines.

The top of her garment, mixing shades of blue, white, green and gray, recalls the color of the bench and the flowers to the girl's right. The bottom of her dress, striped with shades of green, recalls the different tones of the vegetation in the background. The light beige of the girl's skin and the darker beige of the hat echo the golden light found at the top left of the canvas, where the vegetation is less abundant.[1]

Morisot develops a painting where the forms dissolve to suggest impressions, an atmosphere linked to the model and the place represented. In this work, it is not only the face of the young girl, her features and her physical particularities that interest Morisot, but also her attitude and the impression she gives. The bust of the young girl is very straight, her pose is restrained, with her hands resting on her thighs, and her gaze remains fixed: the whole portrait seems to reflect a certain uneasiness in the young girl, sitting alone on the bench.

This impression of unease is contrasted, however, with a soft, spring-like light, the harmonious shades and tones and the smile sketched on the young girl's lips. Berthe Morisot suggests an impression of movement in the vegetation and in the model's hair, as if a light wind was crossing the garden. The harmony and the softness of the landscape produces a peaceful atmosphere which attenuates the stiffness of the young girl.

The work, by its date of creation and by the aesthetics that develops there – an aesthetics of impression and sensations, of movement and of nature, an aesthetics where forms dissolve, where the touch is broad and where colors and light have a more important role than line and drawing belongs to the current of Impressionism which developed in the last quarter of the 19th century. Morisot was part of this artistic current, alongside artists like Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, with whom she maintained an important artistic relationship.[1]

This painting was exhibited for the first time in 1896, during a posthumous exhibition of the artist, under the title On the Bench, with the dates of ""1888-1893"". Her daughter, Julie Manet, and her husband Ernest Rouart, a watercolor painter, both heirs to the artist's work, lend Young Girl in a Park to the “Libre Esthétique” exhibition in Brussels, Belgium, from February 25 to March 29, 1904, a retrospective on impressionist painting, where the critics gave Berthe Morisot her rightful place, alongside the greatest artists of the late 19th century. Juliet Manet and Ernest Rouart donated the painting to the Musée des Augustins, in Toulouse, in 1905.[2]

The work has since been kept in the Salon Rouge of the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse, a room that brings together 19th and early 20th century art in France.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q591762,"The Isenheim Altarpiece is an altarpiece sculpted and painted by, respectively, the Germans Nikolaus of Haguenau and Matthias Grünewald in 1512–1516.[1] It is on display at the Unterlinden Museum at Colmar, Alsace, in France. It is Grünewald's largest work and is regarded as his masterpiece. It was painted for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Issenheim near Colmar, which specialized in hospital work. The Antonine monks of the monastery were noted for their care of plague sufferers as well as for their treatment of skin diseases, such as ergotism. The image of the crucified Christ is pitted with plague-type sores, showing patients that Jesus understood and shared their afflictions. The veracity of the work's depictions of medical conditions was unusual in the history of European art.[2]

The altarpiece has two sets of wings, displaying three configurations:

Wings closed:

With the exception of certain holy days, the wings of the altarpiece were kept closed, displaying The Crucifixion framed on the left by the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows and on the right by Saint Anthony the Great, who remains placid even while being taunted by a frightening monster. The two saints protect and heal the sick, Saint Anthony as the patron saint of the victims of Saint Anthony's fire, and Saint Sebastian, whose aid was invoked to ward off the plague. Grünewald's Crucifixion stands as one of the most poignant representations of this scene in Western art, due to the artist's masterful depiction of horrific agony, with Christ's emaciated body writhing under the pain of the nails driven through his hands and feet. This body covered with sores and riddled with thorns must have terrified the sick, but it also left no doubt about Christ's suffering, thus comforting them in their communion with the Saviour, whose pain they shared. ""Grünewald depicts Jesus' body ravaged by crucifixion yet evokes pointedly the Christian message of Jesus' horrible suffering; originally intended for a hospital, the altar painting may have been designed to provide comfort and solace to the sick.""[3] Mary, the mother of Jesus, is shown at Christ's right, collapsing in anguish in the arms of John, the beloved disciple of Christ, and shrouded in a large piece of white cloth. Also at Christ's right is Mary Magdalene, kneeling with hands clasped in prayer.

At Christ's left, John the Baptist is accompanied by a lamb, symbolising the sacrifice of Jesus. The presence of John the Baptist is anachronistic. Beheaded by order of Herod in 29 AD, he could not possibly have witnessed the death of Christ. This last figure announces the New Testament by crying out in Latin, illum oportet crescere me autem minui (Vulgate, John 3:30), ""He must increase, but I must decrease.""[4] The inclusion of John the Baptist in this scene is symbolic, since he is considered as the last of the prophets to announce the coming of the Messiah.

Outer wings opened:

The outer wings of the Isenheim Altarpiece were opened for important festivals of the liturgical year, particularly those in honour of the Virgin Mary.
Thus are revealed four scenes: the left wing represents the Annunciation during which the archangel Gabriel comes to announce to Mary that she will give birth to Jesus, the son of God. The Virgin Mary is depicted in a chapel to indicate the sacred character of the event. In the central corpus, the Concert of Angels and the Nativity are not independent scenes but instead fit within a unified concept: the viewer witnesses Christ's coming to earth as a newborn baby, who will be led to combat the forces of evil personified by certain of the angels, disturbing in their physical appearance. 

A number of symbols provide keys to aid in interpretation: the enclosed garden represents Mary's womb and is a sign of her perpetual virginity, the rose bush without thorns refers to her as free of original sin, the fig tree symbolises mother's milk. The bed, the bucket and the chamber pot underscore the human nature of Christ. Lastly, the right wing shows the Resurrection, in which Christ emerges from the tomb and ascends into Heaven bathed in light transfiguring the countenance of the Crucified into the face of God. The Resurrection and the Ascension are therefore encapsulated in a single image.

Inner wings opened:

– The sculptures of Saint Augustine and Guy Guers, Saint Anthony, Two Bearers of Offerings, Saint Jerome, Christ and the Twelve Apostles are by Niclaus of Haguenau.  With its inner wings open, the altarpiece allowed pilgrims and the afflicted to venerate Saint Anthony, protector and healer of Saint Anthony's fire. Saint Anthony occupies the place of honour at the centre of the corpus and at his side a pig is depicted, the emblem of the Antonite order. On his left and right, two bearers of offerings illustrate these contributions in kind, an important source of income for the Antonites. This central section is framed by Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome, two of the four great fathers of the Latin Church. Guy Guyers, who had commissioned the Altarpiece, is depicted kneeling at the feet of Saint Augustine.

– Visit of Saint Anthony to Saint Paul the Hermit.
The two hermits meet in a stunning landscape, intended to represent the Theban Desert. Grünewald created a fantastic universe, surrounding the date palm with a strange mixture of vegetation, in marked contrast with the calmness and tranquillity of the encounter, in which the animals in attendance take part, with the crow bringing two morsels of bread to the two recluses. In this dreamlike scene, medicinal plants, painted in naturalistic fashion, sprout at the feet of the two main figures.

– Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons.
This panel depicts Saint Anthony being tormented by monstrous creatures sent by Satan. Trampled to the ground, beaten with sticks, torn by claws and bitten, Saint Anthony appeals to God for help who sends angels to combat these evil demons. In the lower left corner, the being with webbed feet and a distended belly seems to personify the disease caused by ergot poisoning, resulting in swelling and ulcerous growths.

The iconography of the altarpiece has several unusual elements derived from closely following the accounts left by Saint Bridget of Sweden of her mystical visions. These had long had a significant influence on art, especially on depictions of the Nativity of Christ, a scene not included here.

The altarpiece's location in Alsace has meant that, in recent times, control of the work has alternated between Germany and France according to the fortunes of war.[5] Following the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 and the passing of control to Germany, German writers developed the concept that the altarpiece somehow represented the essential character of the German nation. The work subsequently became an object of extraordinary scenes of veneration in Munich during its temporary relocation there during the First World War, and again when Alsace passed back into French hands at the end of the War.[5]

In the immediate postwar period the altarpiece, with its strong overtones of violent sensation and emotion, became a natural source of inspiration for many painters in the influential Expressionist school, such as George Grosz and Otto Dix.[6][7] It also provided the basis for Paul Hindemith's modernist opera Mathis der Maler. In the later 1930s, it appears to have suffered a temporary decline in official esteem in Germany as a result of the National Socialists’ branding of both Expressionism and of Hindemith's work as ""degenerate"".[8]

Due to renovation work in the former convent and until April 2015, the Isenheim Altarpiece was on view in the local Dominican Church, located about 200 metres from the Unterlinden Museum. This temporary transfer offered an exceptional and unprecedented opportunity to present, alongside Grünewald and Haguenau's monumental masterwork, all three painted works by the Colmar native Martin Schongauer held in Colmar: the Orlier Altarpiece (1470–1475), the Altarpiece of the Dominicans (c. 1480) and the Virgin of the Rose Bush (1473). The altarpiece depicting Saint Catherine and Saint Lawrence (c. 1510) and sculptures from the Late Middle Ages rounded out the presentation.[9]

In mid-2022 the altarpiece was re-shown at the Musée d’Unterlinden after it underwent a cleaning and restoration by a team of restorers led by Anthony Pontabry. Haguenau’s sculptures were restored in the polychrome wood restoration workshop in Paris of the Center for Research and Restoration of Museums of France by a team of sculpture restorers led by Juliette Levy. A study had been conducted by the Research Centre of the Musées de France in 2014 when they determined the state of the altarpiece and established the protocol for its restoration.[10]

The Dead Christ Held by Two Angels is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Marco Palmezzano, finished in 1510. It is housed in the Musée du Louvre of Paris, France.

The centre of the scene is occupied by the dead figure of Christ, portrayed with great attention to anatomical details, but also with evident religious piety; the brightness of his body is further enhanced by the dark stone, resembling a black cave, depicted in the background. This contrast can also have the allegorical meaning of Jesus leaving sin and death behind his shoulders. Jesus assumes in this way the evangelic role of proclamation of the end of the dark era of humanity, as also remembered by the presence of the two angels.

The work is influenced by those of Giovanni Bellini, which Palmezzano saw in his sojourn in Venice in 1489–1495.

The painting depicts a stormy sea on a winter day. The cliff in the background is at Étretat, (Seine Maritime); Monet frequently stayed in the area during the winter of 1864–65, and wrote: ""I spend my time outdoors on the rocks when the weather's rough [...] and of course I work all the time."" Monet composed the painting in February 1883 from his hotel window.[1] Subsequently, the painting was bought by the Parisian dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, and then became the property of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon in 1902. The museum was a forerunner in the collecting of early 20th century Impressionist paintings.[2]

The painting is composed of four major elements, each painted in a different way. The central part is invaded by the pearlized surfs painted in forms of commas. In the foreground, a small beach on which there are old boats filled with thatch on the left, and two fishermen with their boats in poor condition that ran aground on the shore. On the left, in the background, the cliff of Étretat can be seen and the rock strata are evoked by horizontal lines of brush.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29857714,"The Murder of the Bishop of Liège is an 1828 or 1829 oil on canvas painting by Eugène Delacroix, showing the murder of Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège by William I de La Marck's men during the 15th-century Wars of Liège, as told in chapter 22 of Walter Scott's historical novel Quentin Durward.[1] First exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1831, it is now in the Louvre in Paris.

Its violent subject is typical of French Romantic painting and places it alongside the same artist's The Death of Sardanapalus and The Execution of Doge Marino Faliero, also painted in the late 1820s. He produced it at the same time as Boissy d’Anglas Leading a Riot (a chiaroscuro scene of revolutionary violence in a huge room) and The Battle of Nancy (similarly inspired by late medieval warfare).[2]

Delacroix spent May to August 1825 in Great Britain, becoming devoted to its literature, especially Scott and William Shakespeare. Murder was just one of several works by the painter to be inspired by Quentin Durward[3] – two sketches survive of The Ardennes Boar (ink on paper, showing William I de La Marck, 15 x 10.5 cm, c. 1827–1829, private collection, Paris[3]) and Quentin Durward and La Balafré (sketch, c.1828–1829, musée des beaux-arts de Caen).

Murder was commissioned by the Duke of Orléans, the future king Louis-Philippe, who became its owner. Its chiaroscuro setting was inspired by Westminster Hall in London and the Palais de Justice in Rouen. Delacroix' correspondence shows him to have been worried about the work, only completing it once he was sure it would be his ""Austerlitz"" not his Waterloo.[2] For some time it was exhibited at the gallery of Henri Gaugain, an art dealer and publisher[4] before being put on show at the 1831 Paris Salon.[5]

For Étienne-Jean Delécluze, ""this little canvas yells, shouts, blasphemes ... one hears the tipsy soldiers' obscene songs. Such figures of brigands! ... What jovial and bloodthirsty bestiality! It swarms and squeaks just as it blazes and stinks!.[6] Théophile Gautier was enthusiastic about the work, stating that ""for the movement and fury of its composition, it is an inimitable masterpiece, a painted whirlwind, everything moving frantically in this little space, emerging from which one seems to hear lamentations and thunder ; never have we seen thrown onto a canvas a crowd more hard, more swarming, more screaming or more enraged [...] This painting is truly tumultuous and loud ; we hear it as much as we see it.[7] However, classical art critics savaged the work as too innovative – ""[The same artist's] The Bridge at Taillebourg was a painting by a savage, and The Murder of the Bishop of Liège is furious debauchery by a barbarian. What is he in himself? A monkey adorned with Titian's meltwater.""[8]

Village Fête (or in Fr. La Fête villageoise) is an oil-on-canvas by French artist of the Baroque Claude Lorrain (real name Claude Gellée), painted in 1639 and given to Louis XIV in 1693 together with its companion Seaport at Sunset, by landscape architect and gardener André Le Nôtre.  It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris.

Claude's Liber Veritatis, a register in which he recorded and drew the paintings he had done, has a note on the back of the drawing for the  Fête (No. 13) that the picture had been painted for Urban VIII. Other sources also state that the artist painted a Village Fête and a Seaport at Sunset for Urban VIII, but these two paintings were sold by Prince Barberini in 1798.[1] The Louvre painting must therefore be a replica painted by Claude Lorrain after the lost original. Another copy dated 1669 was in the possession of Lord Yarborough in England, and yet another in the Stroganovs collection, St. Petersburg. Several other replicas and copies exist.

This particular painting, painted fairly early in the artist's career, reveals the influence of Flemish art. The composition, with a group of trees in the centre, and openings on either side through which the light appears, was often used by Flemish landscape painters from the time of Bruegel: Paul and Matthew Bril frequently employed it, and Lorrain continued in their tradition in Rome. In accordance with classic 16th century procedure, the bridge harmoniously unites the middle and far distance. Through the opening on the right can be seen a city bathed in a golden mist, more characteristic of the campagna romana (Roman countryside) than of the North. Following the usual practice of studios of the Low Countries, Lorrain often employed other artists to paint the little figures in his pictures; but this does not seem to have been the case here, to judge by the unity of conception between figures and landscape.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1448728,"The Annunciation is an oil painting by the Italian master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, finished around 1608. It housed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nancy.

The painting has been considerably damaged and retouched, and what remains of Caravaggio's brushwork is the angel, who bears a resemblance to the figure in John the Baptist at the Fountain. The illusionistic treatment of the angel,  floating on his cloud and seeming to protrude outside the picture plane, is more Baroque than is normal for Caravaggio, but the contrast between the energetic pose of the heavenly messenger and the receptive Mary is dramatically and psychologically effective. The loose brushwork is typical of Caravaggio's later period.

The painting was given by Henry II, Duke of Lorraine, to his primatial church in Nancy as the main altarpiece, and was perhaps acquired by one of the Duke's sons in the course of a visit to Malta in 1608.

The painting is composed of two figures. The angel above the Virgin is attributed to being Gabriel who was the angel of the annunciation. The lilies that Gabriel holds are also a symbol of the Virgin. The Virgin is in a prostrate position as she is being told by Gabriel of God's plan for her. The painting exhibits Caravaggio's signature sfumato and tenebrism, with almost the entire painting being dark except for the two main figures.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4726754,"Aline Chassériau is an 1835 oil-on-canvas painting by French romantic artist Théodore Chassériau, which represents Aline Chassériau (1822–1871), the painter's younger sister. Once owned by the artist's brother Frédéric, it was given to the Musée du Louvre by Baron Arthur Chassériau and his wife in 1918.[1]

Aline (born Geneviève) Chassériau posed for this portrait when she was thirteen years of age, and the painter sixteen.[2] In a nearly monochromatic design, Aline is depicted standing in front of a dark background. She wears a brown cloak with a white collar, and looks directly at the viewer with her hands crossed before her. The expression is somber, the handling of light assured. The refined technique of the portrait was influenced by Ingres, with whom Chassériau had recently studied, and Italian Renaissance masters Raphael and Bronzino.[3]

It had long been thought that the model for this painting was Chassériau's older sister Adèle, but pencil drawings of Aline, as well as renewed attention to the visual evidence—the subject is  adolescent, and Adèle was twenty-five at the time—have corrected the misconception.[3] Chassériau frequently used his siblings, especially his sisters, as models for drawing and painting. As a young man, his relationship to his sisters has been described as so close as to have been ""almost amorous"".[3] Chassériau's first mistress, Clémence Monnerot, later recalled: ""Adèle, Aline and I were Théodore's models for many years. He drew at night under lamplight and posed us as he liked. Adèle has superb arms; they appear everywhere....They are, too, young ladies, his two idealized sisters and their friend, whom he worshipped"".[3]

Her father Benoît Chassériau was a French diplomat, French spy and Minister of the Interior of Simón Bolívar in Cartagena, Colombia.

Aline did not marry, and died in 1871 during the Paris Commune in Bordeaux.

The painting depicts a dispute between Peter and Paul at Antioch in 50 CE, as narrated in the second chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Galatians. The dispute was whether Christian salvation was available only to Jews or also to non-Jews (Gentiles). St Paul is almost certainly the green and red-robed younger bearded man on the left, with a sword rising behind him, forging forward with his entourage to proselytize the outside world. On the right of the canvas, the elder white-haired man, in a yellow robe is led back into the city to administer the church.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9850868,"The Lute Player is an oil-on-canvas painting from 1623 or 1624 now in the Louvre by the Haarlem painter Frans Hals, showing a smiling actor wearing a jester's costume and playing a lute.


This painting was documented by Wilhelm von Bode in 1883, Ernst Wilhelm Moes in 1909 and Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote:
98. A FOOL WITH A MANDOLINE. B. 45; M. 216.- Half-length. A man turned half-right, in a red costume trimmed with yellow. He has long hair, and wears a red and yellow cap. His head is seen in full face; he looks up to the left. With his right hand he touches the strings of a mandoline; his left hand grasps the neck. Very freely handled. Especially good are the various contrasting flesh-tones, the red and yellow of the costume, and the reflections in the eyes. [Compare 95.] Signed in the right at top, F. H.; canvas, about 29 inches by 24 inches. A copy (B. 16, and see M. 216) is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1907 catalogue, No. 1093; it measures 26 inches by 24 inches, having rather less at the foot than the original. In the collection of Baron Gustave de Rothschild, Paris.[1]
The theme of a lute player painted at half length originated in Italy, and the Dutch painter Dirck van Baburen first introduced this theme in the Northern Netherlands with his lute player of 1622. Baburen's player is pointing his lute towards the viewer with his mouth open in song. Hals' player is looking up and smiling naturally, as if he is playing with a singer or another musician not in view. This painting is a good example of Hals' ""rough style"" of painting with loose brush strokes.

A period copy now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum has been dated before 1626 based on an engraving, and it has been attributed variously to Hals, his brother Dirk, and Judith Leyster.[2][3][4]

Two other paintings of lute players by Hals are:

The Fingernail Test

Boy with a Glass and a Lute

Hals was not the only painter to be influenced by Baburen. Hendrik ter Brugghen painted several lute players in the 1620s, and a few of them seem to merge aspects of Baburen and Hals, though his later version seems to follow Hals more closely.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1215717,"The Coronation of the Virgin is a painting by the Italian early Renaissance master Fra Angelico, executed around 1434–1435 in Fiesole (Florence). It is now in the Musée du Louvre of Paris, France. The artist executed another Coronation of the Virgin (c. 1432), now in the Uffizi in Florence.

The work is not thought to have originally been painted around 1434 (a few years after the similar painting in the Uffizi) for the convent of San Domenico of Fiesole, near Florence, where Fra Angelico was a Dominican friar and for which he painted also the Fiesole Altarpiece (1424-1425) and the Annunciation now at the Museo del Prado. Some art historians, such as John Pope-Hennessy, date it instead to Angelico's visit to Rome (1450).

The painting was brought to France as a result of the pillages of the Napoleonic Wars. Like several other artworks, it was not given back with the excuse of its large size.

The work shows several  differences from the earlier Coronation now at the Uffizi. The gilded background has disappeared, replaced by a more realistic light blue sky. The composition is more advanced, perhaps inspired to the innovation introduced by Masaccio. Angelico here  depicts a rich  cyborium with Gothic triple mullions, supported by a series of polychrome marble steps, as the set of the Incoronation. Elements such as the  twisted columns show similarities with the tabernacles painted in the frescoes of the Niccoline Chapel in Rome.

Such as in the Florence painting, the angels and the saints form the audience at the side of the central scene, but the figures are more defined and some are shown from back, and the pavement's tiles are painted according to geometrical perspective. Pope-Hennessy supposed that the angels were influenced by those in the San Brizio Chapel of Orvieto Cathedral (1447).

The work was executed with the extensive help of assistants, especially in the right side: for example, St. Catherine's wheel is painted approximatively, and some of the saints in this side have less expressive faces.

The painting has a predella with scenes portraying the Miracles of St. Dominic and, in the middle, the Resurrection of Christ. Such as in other Angelico's work, the predella scenes show an extensive use of geometrical perspective, enhanced by the use of alternatively empty and full architectures.

At the time its subject had fled France and was living in exile in his mother Marie de Medici's court in Brussels. Already official painter to Charles I of England (husband of Gaston's sister Henrietta Maria), Van Dyck passed through the city in March 1632 - a document shows that in August 1632 Charles I paid van Dyck for a full-length painting of ""his brother-in-law, Monsieur, the brother of the king of France"". However, the painting has alternatively been dated to 1634, the date given in a later inscription added to the painting - that year van Dyck was again in the Spanish Netherlands.

The painting was sold to the Earl of Hutchinson in 1649 and is mentioned in an 1816 London sale by Christie's, at which it was bought by the Prince Regent. After the Regent had come to the throne in his own right as George IV, he gave it as a gift to the duke of Orléans in 1829. The Duke's youngest son Henri inherited it from Marie-Amelie of the Two Sicilies in 1866. He initially kept it at Twickenham during his British exile, before moving it to the salle de la Tribune in his château de Chantilly, where it still hangs as part of the Musée Condé.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1239950,"L'Absinthe (English: The Absinthe Drinker or Glass of Absinthe) is a painting by Edgar Degas, painted between 1875 and 1876.[1] Its original title was Dans un Café,[2] a name often used today.[3]

Other early titles were A sketch of a French Café and Figures at Café. Then, when exhibited in London in 1893, the title was changed to L'Absinthe, the name by which the painting is now commonly known. It is in the permanent collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.

Painted in 1875–76, the work portrays a woman and man[1] sitting side-by-side, drinking a glass of absinthe. They appear lethargic and lonely.[3] The man, wearing a hat, looks to the right off the edge of the canvas, while the woman, dressed more formally in fashionable dress and hat, stares vacantly downward. A glass filled with absinthe is on the table in front of her. The models used in the painting are Ellen Andrée, an actress who also appeared in Édouard Manet's paintings Chez le père Lathuille and Plum Brandy, and Marcellin Desboutin,[3] a painter and etcher.[4] The café where they are taking their refreshment is the Café de la Nouvelle-Athènes in Paris.[5]

At its first showing in 1876, the picture was panned by critics, who called it ugly and disgusting.[5] It was put into storage until being exhibited again in 1892, but was again treated with derision.[5] The painting was shown again at the Grafton Gallery in England in 1893, this time entitled L'Absinthe, where it sparked even greater controversy.[3] The people and the absinthe represented in the painting were considered by English critics to be shockingly degraded and uncouth.[6] Many regarded the painting as a blow to morality; this was the general view of such Victorians as Sir William Blake Richmond and Walter Crane when shown the painting in London. That reaction was typical of the age, revealing the deep suspicion with which Victorian England had regarded art in France since the early days of the Barbizon School, and the desire to find a morally uplifting lesson in works of art. Many English critics viewed the picture as a warning lesson against absinthe, and the French in general. The comment by George Moore on the woman depicted was: ""What a whore!"" He added, ""the tale is not a pleasant one, but it is a lesson"". However, in his book Modern Painting, Moore regretted assigning a moral lesson to the work, claiming that ""the picture is merely a work of art, and has nothing to do with drink or sociology.""[7]

It is currently kept at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[1]

The painting was the last of the four portraits of groups that Fantin-Latour devoted to his friends and celebrities in the arts world. He referred here to the concerts given by the group known as ""Le Petit Bayreuth"" initiated by Antoine Lascoux. Around the Piano received more critical acclaim than his previous works, but remains the least known of his series of four group portraits, perhaps because the people depicted are less famous.

Exhibited at the Salon of 1885, the painting was called The Wagnerists by visitors, as the person seated at the piano was thought to be Camille Saint-Saëns, a composer who was an early supporter of Wagner. Adolphe Jullien, a close friend of Latour, rejected this name, saying that Fantin did not want to paint an artistic manifesto, but simply a gathering of friends, and that the score on the piano, although indistinct, was a piece by Brahms.[2]

It is held at the Louvre Museum, in Paris, under inventory number INV 414.[1]

This painting represents the musical feast given in at the Teatro Argentina, in Rome, by the Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld, the French Ambassador to the Holy See, on July 15, 1747, in honor of the marriage of the Dauphin Louis, son of Louis XV of France, with Maria Josepha of Saxony, Dauphine of France, who had been celebrated at Versailles, on February 9, 1747. France was then involved in the question of influencing the policy of the Holy See, which was more favorable to the House of Austria. This painting, commissioned by Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld, was acquired by the Louvre Museum before 1832 from the collection of king Louis Philippe.[2]

On stage, a painted decor of fantastic columns with caryatids stands before four rows of musicians half-hidden in a decor of clouds, while the four singers, playing the role of Olympian gods dressed like in the ancient times, are seated in the front row facing the spectators. Musicians are shown on either side playing their stringed instruments of which the cellos and double basses are the most visible. Two choirs are also visible on either side of the stage. The work being performed was the baroque opera La Contesa dei Numi by Leonardo Vinci (1690-1730), composed in 1729, specially for the birth of the Dauphin, to a libretto by Pietro Metastasio.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q594470,"St. Michael Vanquishing Satan is a painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael. The image consists of the archangel Michael standing on top of Satan's back with his right foot.  Both works have been located in the Louvre in Paris since 1667. The painting was commissioned by Pope Leo X.

This painting has symbolic meaning within the Christian religion as it symbolizes God triumphing over evil. Raphael had a gift for creating images that evoked divinity in a subtle way and was known being skillful at creating space within his compositions as well as movement captured at a stand still. Techniques that were used by Raphael were adopted at the Academie royale de peinture et de sculpture by Charles Le Brun as the foundation of French classicism. Raphael as an artist was known to stand his ground even against popes and cardinals. Having a father who was also an artist, he had the upper hand with navigating the art field.

Raphael first visited the subject of the archangel Michael at the behest of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. The miniature was completed in 1504 or 1505 on the back of a draughtboard.  The commission is believed to express appreciation to Louis XII of France for conferring the Order of Saint Michael on Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Urbino's nephew and heir.[1] A little more than a decade after completing the little St. Michael, Raphael was commissioned to revisit the theme producing St. Michael Vanquishing Satan for Pope Leo X.[2] Other sources state that the painting was originally a gift to Francois I. By 1667, the painting was placed in the Louvre by King Louis XIV. Questions have arisen in the past about whether the painting was actually done by Raphael or if his apprentice, Giulio Romano created this piece. It was atypical for Raphael to use color in such a manner. Combing orange, yellow, and gold to create a metallic finish was not typically found in his paintings. Black ink was also incorporated to darken the image while adding the effect of smoke.[3] This painting can be tied to a collected group of elite people in France known as the Order of Saint Michael. It was used as an iconic image to represent power within the French government. 

The image is of the Archangel Michael when he's younger in age amidst a rocky scenery. Michael stands on top of the devil with one leg while holding up his spear to deliver a strike to his head. His wings are depicted open while the devil's are closed signifying defeat. The ideal figures that he would create were done so not to overpower the image, but with grace and reservation. Author George B. Rose claims that, ""Even though color wasn’t his expertise, Raphael always used it appropriately. His use of lines were masterful and had a decorative quality to them. Raphael had great skill in portraying space through his compositions and it wasn’t always tied to having a distant background. Regardless of the sense of space created, Raphael had an ability to juxtapose the vastness of nature with man’s dominion over it. Man is always dominant, and the land is subservient to man's will.""[4] Here man is portrayed as the master through the image of Raphael and Satan is the subservient creature. A lot of these stylistic qualities were passed down to Raphael by his teacher and master, Pietro Perugino.[4] When comparing paintings with Leonardo da Vinci, it is evident that Raphael was inspired by his technique of creating action that is suspended in time. The way in which Raphael's body is depicted with arm raised and foot planted on the back of Satan gives a sense of motion. The eye follows the lines of the body from the tip of the spear towards the head of the serpent. He also skillfully appropriates the style in which Michelangelo would portray the male nude. One specific technique for which Michelangelo is famous that is found in much of Raphael's art is the twisted pose as is depicted here with Raphael. Raphael had the privilege of accessing works by Leonardo and Michelangelo due to the fact that many of their artworks were commissioned by Florentine patrons. Having studied in Florence, Raphael had the opportunity to utilize these resources to his advantage.[5]

Raphael's painting was chosen as the central topic for Charles Le Brun's first class session at the Academie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1667. During the lecture, he compared St. Michael's musculature to that of sculptures of Apollo. Charles also noted that even though the image is frozen still, the positioning of St. Michael's body suggests movement. In opposition to this action, the facial expression of the angel is very calm and collected. This is a reference to the authority that heaven has over hell. These insights that the professor made from this painting were then used as the building blocks to French classicism especially at the Academie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Three concepts that Charles grasped from Raphael's painting include: monotone color scheme to keep things connected within the composition, having a main concept that's simple, and positioning the human form in some kind of way to create the illusion of movement. These were key in understanding French classicism during this time period.[3]

Raphael's father was Giovanni Santi who was also a painter as well as a poet. Due to this fact, Raphael had certain connections with patrons throughout his career which helped his notoriety. Considered a favorite for Pope Julius II, Raphael held a celebrity status in Rome from 1509 to 1520.[6] The artist died at the very young age of 37 due to a fever. His body was buried in the Pantheon where a huge procession gathered. Paintings done by Raphael are described as elevating the human experience to a heavenly place by creating figures that are indicative of the perfect bodies that humanity would obtain once in heaven. He had the ability to create feelings of divinity without affecting its ability to move people here on Earth. His paintings have a humble quality to them. He used aesthetics to represent men and women as refined in reference to the Bible so as to encourage believers. He kept the humanity of the character in order for the viewers to have something to relate to. His images gave the viewer a renewed faith and hope for a brighter future. This image touches on the idea of elevating ones faith by depicting an image where heaven is defeating hell which is an important concept within the Christian faith. George B. Rose praised the artist by saying, ""Beauty in the context of Renaissance painting was established by Raphael and he is said to have set the standard for other artists.""[7] Even though Raphael had success, he had his differences amongst the elites of his time including Popes, cardinals, literati, and dukes. According to the art historian Giorgio Vasari, Raphael was an artist that had created his own style of painting by learning from previous masters and applying it to his works. Raphael was born in the city of Urbino in the year 1483. He moved to Florence in 1504 to study art.  Having been exposed to the aesthetics of Florentine painters, Raphael’s painting skills were elevated and refined. He adopted a certain style that emphasized musculature within the human form and a sense of tension created with intense compositions.[6]

Raphael's contemporary, Sebastiano of Venice, wrote to Michelangelo in July of the year the painting was completed to complain of the coloring of the work, suggesting that the figure looked smoky or made of iron because of the exaggerated contrast between the two sides.[8] This may have been the hand of Giulio Romano, who according to art historian Eugène Müntz overused black in a heavy-handed fashion to ""obtain a more powerful effect.""[8] To deal with coloring issues, the painting was restored in 1537–1540 by Francesco Primaticcio.[8][9] Following further restoration in 1685, it was transferred from the original wood to canvas in 1753.

Although the representation of the identically dressed sisters suggests twinship, Adèle was thirty-three and Aline was twenty-one when they posed for the portrait.[1] Their age difference is not apparent in the painting. Both sisters have fine, shiny dark hair parted in the middle and tied back in a bun. They wear similar jewelry. Their two figures, outlined in black, stand out against the green background.

The work is a product of Chassériau's early maturity, when he was eager to demonstrate his independence from his former master, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, with whom he had had a falling-out in 1840. Although classically trained under Ingres, Chassériau had become influenced by the Romantic master Eugène Delacroix, as evidenced in this case by the work's strong coloring. He uses almost violent colors, especially in the shawls with which his two sisters are wrapped, a bright red with multi-colored borders.

The painting is considered an in-depth study of psychology.[citation needed]


When The Two Sisters was exhibited in the Salon of 1843, the response of the critics and the public was mixed. One critic, Louis Peisse, wrote:
M. Chassériau wanted, perhaps unnecessarily, to undertake a difficult thing, to do a painting with two figures of women, both full length, of the same height, both in dresses of the same color and the same fabric, with the same shawl, posed in the same manner, and to sustain that gamble of sorts without using any artifice of light or effect, solely through the authority of style, form, and character. Did he succeed adequately? I do not think so. Nevertheless, he executed that tour de force with a resolution and skill that  deserved to prevail.[1]
By the time of Chassériau's death in 1856, The Two Sisters was regarded as one of his most important works.[2]  It entered the collection of the Louvre in 1918.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99469838,"Adoration of the Magi is a 1650s religious painting by the Italian Baroque artist from Genoa, Bartolomeo Biscaino. It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France, for which it was bought in 1878, shortly after the city had decided to rebuild its collections, which had been completely destroyed on 24 August 1870, in the fire of the Aubette during the Siege of Strasbourg. Accordingly, the painting's inventory number is 1.[2][3]

Until 1959, Adoration of the Magi had been thought to be a work by Valerio Castello (of whom the Strasbourg museum also owns a flamboyant Adoration of the Magi), but the attribution to Biscaino has been confirmed several times since. Although the painter died at a very young age and was only about 22 years old when he painted the Strasbourg canvas, the work is a perfectly achieved example of Ligurian Baroque, blending influences of Parmigianino and Correggio with influences of Rubens and Van Dyck.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3335976,"Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau (French: Napoléon sur le champ de bataille d'Eylau) is an oil painting of 1808 by French Romantic painter Antoine-Jean Gros. Completed during the winter of 1807–1808, the work became an icon of the emerging style of French Romanticism. It depicts a moment from the aftermath of the bloody Battle of Eylau (7–8 February 1807) in which Napoléon Bonaparte surveys the battlefield where his Grande Armée secured a costly victory against the Russians. Although Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau retains elements of history painting, it is by far Gros's most realistic work depicting Napoleon and breaks from the subtlety of Neoclassicism. The painting is housed at the Louvre in Paris. 

In early February 1807, the Russian army, under the command of Levin August von Bennigsen, was in full retreat while being pursued by Napoléon Bonaparte's Grande Armée.[1] The field armies of Russia's ally, the Kingdom of Prussia, had been decisively defeated by the Grande Armée at the double Battle of Jena–Auerstedt on 14 October 1806. This left the Russian army as the only major land force opposing Napoléon in the War of the Fourth Coalition.[2] After some failed attempts to disrupt the French advance, Bennigsen decided to regroup his retreating forces at the Prussian village of Eylau (now Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad Oblast).[3]

Fighting began in the afternoon of 7 February when Napoleon's baggage section arrived at Eylau in preparation for the Emperor's arrival, unaware of the Russian presence still in the village. Thinking the French were attempting to capture the village, Bennigsen sent reinforcements to Eylau; Napoléon reciprocated with his own fighting force. Intense engagements followed, especially around the village's church and cemetery, but the French held control of Eylau by the end of the day.[1][2]

The Russians countered in the early morning of 8 February with a massive artillery bombardment. On the brink of a disastrous defeat, Napoléon called upon the Reserve Cavalry Corps to charge the Russian columns approaching Eylau.[4] It disrupted the Russian offensive long enough for the French lines to stabilize. By nightfall, Bennigsen ordered his forces to withdraw: the French, though able to declare a victory, were left with a snowy battlefield riddled with blood and frozen corpses.[2]

Napoléon sought to ensure that the victory at Eylau, though costly, would not be forgotten, entrusting the director of the Louvre Vivant Denon with commissioning an artist as a part of a much larger propaganda campaign.[5] One month after the battle, Denon announced a public competition for the commission: 26 artists sent in their sketches which were exhibited at the Louvre. Antoine-Jean Gros was declared the winner on 13 June, and completed Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau during the winter of 1807–1808.[5] According to François de Vergnette, Denon stipulated much of what was to be featured in the painting, including ""the moment to be depicted, the number of 'extras', the cadavers in the foreground, and the large format"".[6]

The painting portrays Napoleon arriving outside Eylau to survey the battlefield on 9 February 1807, the day after the fighting ended. The painting is on a monumental scale of 521 x 784 cm, such that most of the central figures are rendered life-sized.[7] Some of the figures on the edges of the painting are intentionally cut off to instil a feeling of the work being an actual fragment of a real-life scene. The viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the large pile of corpses in the foreground whose faces are twice life-sized; another soldier, wounded, cries out in a state of madness.[6][7] According to the 64th Grande Armée Bulletin, the scene was designed ""to instil in princes a love of peace and a horror of war"".[5]

In the center of the painting Napoléon is seen mounted on a light bay horse surveying the treatment of the wounded, his hand outstretched in a pose reminiscent of blessing the soldiers. ""The consoling expression of the great man"", wrote Denon, ""seems to soften the horrors of death and spread a softer light on this scene of carnage"".[5] He is surrounded by members of his staff: Marshal Berthier, Marshal Bessières, and General Caulaincourt are to the left, while Marshal Soult, Marshal Davout and Marshal Murat flank on the right.[5] A wounded Lithuanian soldier, taken aback by the compassion of the Emperor, pledges his allegiance to Napoléon while another former combatant embraces his leg.[6]

Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau was first shown at the Paris Salon in 1808. Initially, some politicians suspected the painting aimed to portray the Emperor unfavorably, but Napoléon himself approved of Gros's work and presented him with the Légion d'honneur at the painter's award ceremony.[6] Gros's depiction of Napoléon displayed a degree of realism not present in his earlier painting of the Emperor, Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa (1804), nor those by any other artist. In its portrayal of the unpleasant truth of war, Napoléon on the Battlefield of Eylau breaks with the prevailing style of Neoclassicism and was an early landmark in the emerging Romantic movement.[6] Its influence is apparent in the works of French artists like Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, themselves both pioneers of Romanticism.[8]

It is held in the department of prints and drawings at the Louvre with other drawings of bullfights by the same artist, notably Picador and Chuletillo (lead pencil, 1832).[1]

The work's small dimensions allowed him to compete with the sinister The Bullfights of Bordeaux by Goya.[2] Luigina Rossi-Bortolatto considers that the work's poses draw on the painter's The Battle of Nancy, painted the previous year.[3] The man's simple gesture and the soft colours of the clothes are a major contrast with his paintings such as The Lion Hunt[4]

Diana It is now in the Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature in Paris. During his life, Rubens hoped to encourage the painting of classicist hunting scenes.[1]

The figures were painted by Rubens, while the landscape and animals are by Brueghel's hand. The work is made on a panel of 57 x 98 cm and can be viewed in the Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature in Paris.

There has been much discussion about the quality and provenance of the painting. It is not normal for Rubens to sign his work, which is the case in this painting. Brueghel did sign his works. Nor is the painting an example of Rubens' style. It is too gallant and too spacious for that. The brushstrokes are not large and virtuoso, which is characteristic of Rubens. Nevertheless, the painting is an example of a finished combination between Rubens and Brueghel.

Brueghel is known for his beautiful paintings of landscapes, animals and flowers. For the figures he collaborated with other painters, as is the case here. Brueghel often collaborated with Rubens before the latter left for Italy in 1610.

It is now in the Louvre in Paris.[1]

Based on Diderot's account of the 1761 Salon,[2] the work shows a son announcing to his family that he is leaving to join the army, with his father forbidding it. The work forms a pair with Greuze's The Son Punished.[3]

The subject of the painting[4] is a scene from a family drama, when the son announces to his father that he is leaving for the army and the father curses him. The Curse of the Father, part of a diptych, is associated with another painting by Greuze, The Son Punished.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24930281,"Archduke Leopold Wilhelm Hunting Heron or Heron Hunting Scene with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm is a 1652-1656 oil on canvas painting by David Teniers the Younger, now in the Louvre Museum, in Paris. A simple scene of falcons being used to hunt heron on the surface, it conceals a political allegory.[1]

Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria became governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1647, making Teniers his official court painter and curator of his art collection in the region's capital, Brussels, seen in the background.[2] Five years later the Prince de Condé (loyal to Philip IV of Spain) took his army to the Spanish Netherlands, leading to a conflict with Louis XIV's France in the south of the Spanish-held region, a conflict which set the context for the painting.[3][4]

At that time a struggle between a heron and a falcon was a commonly-held symbol of a battle with an uncertain outcome,[5] with the heron here representing the Spanish Netherlands, under attack from both France and the Dutch Republic (the two falcons shown) but still hopeful of victory rather than resigned to defeat.[6]

Until 1784 it was in the collection of Joseph Hyacinthe François-de-Paule de Rigaud, comte de Vaudreuil, France's Grand Falconer. Hit by financial problems, he sold off his art collection in two public auctions in 1784 and 1787.[7] Hunting Heron was bought as lot 32 at the first sale by Louis XVI, along with around thirty other paintings, mostly Flemish and Dutch and all intended for the royal collections in the Grande Galerie of the Louvre Palace.[8][9]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3203447,"Killing a Deer or A Deer Hunt – The Kill (French: L'Hallali du cerf), is a very large picture (355 by 505 cm), representing a hunting scene, painted in 1867 by Gustave Courbet. The picture is currently on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'Archéologie of Besançon.

The painting was done during the winter of 1866–1867. It is in the large format newly adopted by Courbet, as also in A Burial at Ornans and The Artist's Studio. The work was exhibited at the French art salons and academies of 1869. The picture caused some scandal, major formats being previously reserved for noble history paintings rather than hunting scenes.

The scene shows a deer attacked by a pack of hunting dogs and collapsed on the snowy ground. Two characters are on the right. The drill is Cusenier Jules, a resident of Ornans while the man on horseback is Felix Gaudy, of Vuillafans.[1] L'Hallali is in the tradition of representation of the scene hunt, from the seventeenth century. Courbet uses a harsh realistic representation closer to Flemish models. Hunting scenes are common in the paintings of Courbet; every step of the chase is represented

There is another influence in this painting, that of The Massacre at Chios (1824) by Eugène Delacroix (illustrated). His influence is reflected particularly through the mounted character.[2]

Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1, best known under its colloquial name Whistler's Mother or Portrait of Artist's Mother,[1][2] is a painting in oils on canvas created by the American-born painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler in 1871. The subject of the painting is Whistler's mother, Anna McNeill Whistler. The painting is 56.81 by 63.94 inches (1,443 mm × 1,624 mm),[3] displayed in a frame of Whistler's own design. It is held by the Musée d'Orsay in Paris,[2] having been bought by the French state in 1891. It is one of the most famous works by an American artist outside the United States. It has been variously described as an American icon[3][4][5][6] and a Victorian Mona Lisa.[3][7][8]

Anna McNeill Whistler posed for the painting while living in London with her son at Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.[9]

Several unverifiable stories relate to the painting of the work; one is that Anna Whistler acted as a replacement for another model who could not make the appointment. Allegedly, Whistler originally envisioned painting the model standing up. However, his mother was too uncomfortable to pose standing for an extended period.

The work was shown at the 104th Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Art in London (1872), after coming within a hair's breadth of rejection by the Academy. This episode worsened the rift between Whistler and the British art world; Arrangement was the last painting he submitted for the Academy's approval (although his etching of Old Putney Bridge was exhibited there in 1879). Vol. VIII of The Royal Academy of Arts: A Complete Dictionary of Contributors and their work from its foundation in 1769 to 1904 (by Algernon Graves, F.S.A., London 1906) lists the 1872 exhibit as no. 941, ""Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Painter's mother"", and gives Whistler's address as The White House, Chelsea Embankment.

The sensibilities of a Victorian era viewing audience would not accept what was a portrait exhibited as an ""arrangement"", hence the addition of the explanatory title Portrait of the Painter's mother. From this, the work acquired its enduring nickname of simply Whistler's Mother. After Thomas Carlyle viewed the painting, he agreed to sit for a similar composition, this one titled Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 2. Thus the previous painting became, by default, Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1.

Whistler eventually pawned the painting, acquired in 1891 by Paris's Musée du Luxembourg. Whistler's works, including this one, had attracted several imitators. Numerous similarly posed and restricted-colour palette paintings soon appeared, particularly by American expatriate painters. For Whistler, having one of his paintings displayed in a major museum helped attract wealthy patrons. In December 1884, Whistler wrote:[citation needed]

Just think—to go and look at one's own picture hanging on the walls of Luxembourg—remembering how it had been treated in England—to be met everywhere with deference and respect...and to know that all this is ... a tremendous slap in the face to the Academy and the rest! Really it is like a dream.
As a proponent of ""art for art's sake"", Whistler professed to be perplexed and annoyed by the insistence of others upon viewing his work as a ""portrait"". In his 1890 book The Gentle Art of Making Enemies, he wrote:[10]

Take the picture of my mother, exhibited at the Royal Academy as an ""Arrangement in Grey and Black."" Now that is what it is. To me it is interesting as a picture of my mother; but what can or ought the public to care about the identity of the portrait?
Both Whistler's Mother and Thomas Carlyle were engraved by the English engraver Richard Josey.[11] The image has been used since the Victorian era as an icon for motherhood, affection for parents, and ""family values"" in general, especially in the United States. For example, in 1934, the U.S. Post Office Department issued a stamp engraved with the portrait detail from Whistler's Mother, bearing the slogan ""In memory and in honor of the mothers of America."" In the Borough of Ashland, Pennsylvania, an eight-foot-high statue based on the painting was erected as a tribute to mothers by the Ashland Boys' Association in 1938, during the Great Depression.[12]

The image has been repeatedly appropriated for commercial advertisements and parodies, such as doctored images of the subject watching television, and sometimes accompanied by captions such as ""Whistler's Mother Is Off Her Rocker.""

In summing up the painting's influence, art historian Martha Tedeschi has stated:

Whistler's Mother, Wood's American Gothic, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Edvard Munch's The Scream have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.[13]
Whistler's Mother has been exhibited several times in the United States, notably at the Century of Progress world's fair in Chicago in 1933–34. It was shown at the Atlanta Art Association in the fall of 1962,[14] the National Gallery of Art in 1994, and the Detroit Institute of Arts in 2004.[15] It was exhibited at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1983 in an exhibition called: 
A New World: Masterpieces of American Painting 1760- 1910. 

And from June to September 2006.[citation needed] From May 22 to September 6, 2010, it was shown at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco.[16] The painting was exhibited at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California, from March 27 to June 22, 2015,[17] and then at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts. It was shown at the Art Institute of Chicago from March 4 to May 21, 2017.[18] It had returned to the Musee d'Orsay as of early August 2019.

The painting has been featured or mentioned in numerous works of fiction and within pop culture. These include films such as Sing and Like It (1934), the Donald Duck shorts Early to Bed (1941) & Donald's Diary (1954), The Fortune Cookie (1966), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), Babette's Feast (1986),[19] Bean (1997), I Am Legend (2007), and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 (2013).

English rock musician John Lennon used a self-portrait modeled after the painting on the cover of his 1975 compilation album Shaved Fish.

It has been mentioned in television episodes of The Simpsons (""Rosebud"",[20][21] ""The Trouble with Trillions"",[22][23] and ""The Burns and the Bees""[citation needed]).

The painting is mentioned in Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita.[24]

The painting is mentioned in part six of Don Delillo's novel Underworld.

In a four-part episode of the Underdog cartoon series (Parts 69-72 in the series) entitled ""Whistler's Father"", Underdog is assigned to stand guard in a museum to prevent the theft of a valuable painting called Whistler's Father.

The film The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear (1991) features the shape of the painting as a birthmark that is used to identify a character after he is replaced with an ""evil double.""

The painting is central to the plot of the comedy film Bean (1997), in which Mr. Bean accidentally defaces it during its repatriation to the United States and secretly replaces it with a poster.

The painting was featured in America's Next Top Model, Cycle 5 to inspire the photoshoots for Olay's Quench body lotion, in a modern interpretation of the classical artwork.

Fred Armisen's character Karl Cowperthwaite frequently mentions the painting in season 4 of the TV show Last Man on Earth.

Cole Porter’s Anything Goes lists the painting in the song ""You're the Top"".

Actor Hurd Hatfield toured internationally several times with the play Son of Whistler's Mother by playwright Maggie Williams.[25]

The movie Sneakers (1992) features two characters code-named Whistler and Mother, played by David Strathairn and Dan Aykroyd, respectively.[26]

Between 1959 and 2021, the Douglas A-26 Invader serial number 41-39401 was either flown or displayed with the name of Whistler's Mother. It featured a reproduction of the painting on the nose.

Whistler, and particularly this painting, had a profound effect on Claude Debussy, a contemporary French composer. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist Eugène Ysaÿe describing his Nocturnes as ""an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one color – what a study in grey would be in painting."" Whether Debussy used the term color to refer to orchestration or harmony, critics have observed ""shades"" of a particular sound quality in his music.[27]

Man with a Glove (French: L'Homme au Gant) is an oil-on-canvas portrait by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian, painted c. 1520.[1] It is part of the collections of the Musée du Louvre, Paris.[2]

The work originates from the Gonzaga family's collection at Mantua. It was acquired by Charles I of England in 1627. Sometime after his beheading in 1649, the painting was auctioned and bought by the Cologne banker Eberhard Jabach.  Eventually, it came in the possession of Louis XIV of France, and was transferred from the Palace of Versailles to the Louvre in 1792.

The figure has not been identified with certainty. He could be Girolamo Adorno, mentioned in a 1527 letter from Pietro Aretino to Federico Gonzaga, or Giambattista Malatesta, an agent of the Gonzaga in Venice. According to another hypothesis, he could be Ferrante Gonzaga, who was sixteen years old in 1523.

The painting portrays a three-quarters view of a male figure set against a flat black background. He appears to be looking at an indefinite point to the left of the canvas, with his left arm laid on his knee. He could be pointing at his gloves, which were a fashion statement at the time. He is dressed in a wide jacket and a white shirt, in the fashion of the period.

The man's gloved left hand holds a second leather glove; an accessory used by the most refined gentlemen of the time. His right hand is adorned with a golden ring, a symbol of richness, and a necklace decorated with a sapphire and a pearl.  The use of a parapet in portraits was a common device of the young Titian.

In Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series in the short story Patron of the Arts (first appeared in Worlds of If, Aug 1965), a human artist and a Berserker machine discuss the value of art and of this specific painting on a starship in the future after a space battle near the Sol system. In this short story, the Earth-Descended peoples place all of humanity's important artworks on an evacuation starship to preserve the works by sending them to Tau Epsilon.[3]

In Albert Camus's 1971 novel A Happy Death, a character called Eliane, whom Patrice Meursault describes as an Idealist, thinks that she looks like the figure from the painting and even has various reproductions of the painting decorating her room.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17491975,"Haymaking in the Auvergne (French: Fenaison d'Auvergne or La fenaison en Auvergne) is an 1855 oil painting by French artist Rosa Bonheur. It measures 215 cm × 422 cm (85 in × 166 in).

After her first great artistic success, Ploughing in the Nivernais exhibited in 1849, Bonheur showed studies of two new paintings to French Minister of Fine Arts Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny. He rejected one, The Horse Fair, and commissioned Haymaking in the Auvergne instead. Bonheur focussed on completing The Horse Fair first, and De Morny attempted to change his mind after its good reception at the Paris Salon in 1853.

The painting depicts the loading of a hay onto a cart pulled by four oxen. The beasts to the right wait patiently, attended by a man in wide-brimmed hat. Other men are cutting grass with scythes, while women rake up the hay, and other people use pitchforks to lift the hay onto a large pile on the cart.

The painting was bought by the French state in 1854 for 20,000 francs. It won a gold medal when it was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855, as a pendant to Ploughing in the Nivernais. It was also exhibited as part of the retrospective of 19th century French art at the 1900 Exposition Universelle.

The painting was held at the Musée du Luxembourg from 1874 to 1878, and then moved to the Château de Fontainebleau, where it remains. A smaller version, 71.1 by 129 centimetres (28.0 in × 50.8 in) is in a private collection. The print of an engraving by William Turner Davey was published in London in 1878 by Louis Brall & Sons.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18397401,"Luigi Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry is an 1842 oil-on-canvas allegorical portrait of Luigi Cherubini by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and his then-pupil Henri Lehmann.[1] It was bought from Ingres for 8,000 francs by Louis-Philippe I using civil list money in June 1842 and given to the musée du Luxembourg, before being moved in 1874 to the Louvre Museum, in whose collections it still resides.[2][3]

The work took a long time to produce. Eighteen preparatory drawings are known to exist. It was based on an 1833 portrait of Cherubini by Ingres, of which a pre-1841 copy survives in the Cincinnati Art Museum.[4] To create Luigi Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry, Ingres retrieved the 1833 portrait, cut the head of Cherubini from it, and had it sewn onto a larger canvas.[5] The muse was probably painted by Lehmann – the craquelure which only affects that figure are linked to an overuse of oil and use of bitumen, which seems to indicate an artist other than Ingres, who did not use that medium.[4][6]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17014176,"Portrait de l'éditeur Eugène Figuière, also referred to as The Publisher Eugene Figuiere (Portrait de Figuière, L'Editeur Eugène Figuière, Portrait d'un Editeur, Portrait d'Eugène Figuière or Portrait of the Publisher Eugene Figuiere), is a painting created in 1913 by the artist, theorist and writer Albert Gleizes. This work was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne, 1913 (no. 768) and Moderni Umeni, 45th Exhibition of SVU Mánes in Prague 1914 (no. 47), and several major exhibitions the following years. Executed in a highly Cubist idiom, the work nevertheless retains recognizable elements relative to its subject matter. The painting, reproduced in Comœdia, 14 November 1913,[1] represents Eugène Figuière. Head of his own publishing company, Figuière strove to be identified with every modern development. In 1912 he published the first and only manifesto on Cubism entitled Du ""Cubisme"", written by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger. In 1913 Figuière published Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques (The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations), by Guillaume Apollinaire. The painting, purchased directly from the artist in 1948, is in the permanent collection of the Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon, France.

Portrait of Eugène Figuière is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 143.5 by l01.5 cm (56.5 x 40 inches) signed and dated ""Alb Gleizes 13"", lower right. Studies for this work likely began during the spring or summer of 1913 while the full portrait was completed during the late summer or early fall of 1913. The work represents Eugène Figuière who is closely associated with Gleizes' friends from the Abbaye de Créteil, Jacques Nayral and Alexandre Mercereau.[2]

Eugène Figuière, head of his own publishing company, strove to be identified with every modern development. In this portrait which Salmon admired for its ""fine and most adroit psychology"", he is surrounded by his publications which were written by Gleizes' friends: Alexandre Mercereau, Georges Polti, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Metzinger, Paul Fort, Gustave Kahn, Henri-Martin Barzun and Jacques Nayral.[3]

In this picture Gleizes merges the sitter with the environment, blurring the distinction between background and foreground. In addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective, the artist has included the image of a clock in the upper left quadrant (as in Metzinger's Nu à la cheminée, Nude of 1910), a fact that reveals Gleizes' didactic visual and literary reference to the mathematician and philosopher of science Henri Poincaré, and to the philosopher Henri Bergson's concept of 'duration'.[4]

Outlining his practice at the time, in an essay published in February 1913 in Montjoie! Gleizes writes:

It is sufficient for me to say, quickly, that painters today only consider the object in relation to the totality of things and, with regard to itself, in relation to the totality of its aspects. As they are not unaware of the fact that a form which is more pronounced dominates those which are less pronounced, the plastic dynamism will be born from the rhythmic relations of objects to objects, as with the different aspects of one and the same object, juxtaposed—not superposed, as some would like to believe—with all the sensibility and taste of the painter for whom those are the only rules. (Gleizes, 1913)[5]
La Revue Indépendante began publication in June 1911 under the patronage ('Dépôt générale') of Eugène Figuière, later publisher of  Du ""Cubisme"" and of Apollinaire's Aesthetic Meditations - The Cubist Painters. According to Gladys Fabre, Figuière's publishing house opened in 1910 was a successor, via the Bibliothèque des douze and the Oeuvres du jour to the Abbaye de Créteil's own publishing house which, after the closure of the Abbaye itself in 1908, had continued in Paris. The contributors included the poet Paul Fort together with Alexandre Mercereau, Paul Castiaux, H.M. Barzun, Roger Allard and, quite prominently, Jacques Nayral, Gleizes' friend and later brother in law, subject of the great portrait which must have been done about this time. Nayral had contributed previous pieces in the series L'Art et ses représentants, on Mahler and on the writer Gaston Deschamps (1861-1931). Daniel Robbins' Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Guggenheim, 1964, mentions another article in the series by Gleizes, on Le Fauconnier, but this does not seem to have appeared in print.[2][6]

Du ""Cubisme"" is translated into English: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913. Gleizes exhibits in the Armory Show in New York, Chicago and Boston, introducing Cubism to an American audience. An essay by him, Le Cubisme et la Tradition, attacking the Italian Renaissance and its influence on French art, is published by the Italian born Riccardo Canudo (1877-1923) in his journal, Montjoie!. Figuière publishes a collection of essays by Apollinaire, Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques. Apollinaire uses the word 'la majesté' to characterise Gleizes. In the Salon d'Automne Gleizes exhibits Portrait de Figuière and La Ville et le Fleuve, a monumental successor to Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing) (it has since been lost). At the Salon, Canudo introduces him to Juliette Roche (1884-1982), daughter of a powerful government minister, Jules Roche, and a member of the circle which is portrayed in Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu.[2]

Albert Gleizes writes in 1925:[2][7]

The year 1913 saw the movement continuing to evolve. The changes it had already undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.

At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants could be seen a very large work of Jean Metzinger's - L'Oiseau Bleu; Robert Delaunay showed L'Equipe de Cardiff; two important canvasses from Léger; still lifes and L'Homme au Café from Juan Gris; enthusiastic new work from La Fresnaye and from Marcoussis, and from others again; and finally, from myself, Les Joueurs de Football.


Again, to the Salon d'Automne of 1913 - a salon in which Cubism was now the predominating tendency - Metzinger sent the great picture called En Bâteau (En Canot, Im Boot), La Fresnaye La Conquête de l'Air, myself Les Bâteaux de Pêche and La Ville et le Fleuve. If the first moment of surprise had passed by, the interest Cubism excited was as great as ever. The anger and the enthusiasm had not changed sides, our enemies held to their guns. It is enough for proof to read the diatribes of Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas for that year,1913, and the panegyrics of Guillaume Apollinaire in L'Intransigeant.[2][7]
By 1913 the predominant tendency in modern art visible at the Salon d'Automne consisted of Cubism with a clear tendency towards abstraction. The trend to use brighter colors that had already begun in 1911 continued through 1912 and 1913. This exhibition, held from 15 November to 8 January 1914, was dominated by de La Fresnaye, Gleizes and Picabia. Works by Delaunay, Duchamp and Léger were not exhibited.[8]

The preface of the catalog was written by the French Socialist politician Marcel Sembat who a year earlier—against the outcry of Jules-Louis Breton regarding the use of public funds to provide the venue (at the Salon d'Automne) to exhibit 'barbaric' art—had defended the Cubists, and freedom of artistic expression in general, in the National Assembly of France.[2][9][10][11]

""I do not in the least wish... to offer a defense of the principles of the cubist movement! In whose name would I present such a defense? I am not a painter... What I do defend is the principle of the freedom of artistic experimentation... My dear friend, when a picture seems bad to you, you have the incontestable right not to look at it, to go and look at others. But one doesn't call the police!"" (Marcel Sembat)[9]
In a review of the 1913 Salon d'Automne published in The Burlington magazine for Connoisseurs, the critic Robert E. Dell writes:

As for the ultra-orthodox Cubists such as M. Gleizes, they are becoming very tiresome. Someone who knows M. Eugène Figuière assured me that he saw a strong resemblance in M. Gleizes's portrait of that eminent publisher, who must, in that case, be made of gun-metal or some similar substance. It may be my stupidity, but I cannot understand what this sort of thing means or what the artist is driving at. There are a few other paintings which may, presumably, be called Cubist in default of any better name, which are merely patterns in bright colours, such as M. Picabia's and M. Metzinger's. One of M. Metzinger's pictures is a puzzle made up of a leg, an arm, a hat, a parasol, and various other objects, and is called En Canot. These patterns have certain decorative qualities and might do for a carpet or a hanging, but they are absurd in frames, and it is a mere affectation to give them titles.[12]"
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3080509,"The Valpinçon Bather (Fr: La Grande Baigneuse) is an 1808 painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780–1867), held in the Louvre since 1879. Painted while the artist was studying at the French Academy in Rome, it was originally titled Seated Woman but later became known after one of its nineteenth-century owners.

Ingres had earlier painted female nudes, such as his Bathing Woman of 1807, yet this work is widely regarded as his first great treatment of the subject. As in the previous smaller work, the model is shown from behind, however The Valpinçon Bather lacks the earlier painting's overt sexuality, instead depicting a calm and measured sensuality.[1] Ingres returned to the form of this figure a number of times in his life; culminating in his The Turkish Bath of 1863, where the central figure in the foreground playing a mandolin echoes in rhythm and tone the model of the Valpinçon bather.[2][3]

Although the painting was not met with favour by critics when first exhibited, almost fifty years later, when the artist's reputation was well established, the Goncourt brothers wrote that ""Rembrandt himself would have envied the amber color of this pale torso"", while the Louvre described it as ""a masterpiece of harmonious lines and delicate light"".[4]

Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) described the model as having a ""deep voluptuousness"", yet in many ways she is presented as essentially chaste.[4] This contradiction is apparent in many elements of the painting. The turn of her neck and the curves of her back and legs are accentuated by the fall of the metallic green draperies, the swell of the white curtain in front of her and the folds of the bed sheets and linen. However, these elements are countered by the cool tone in which her flesh is rendered as well as by elements such as the elegant black-veined marble to the left of her.[1]

Remarking on Ingres' ability to paint the human body in a unique manner, the art critic Robert Rosenblum wrote that ""the ultimate effect of [The Valpinçon Bather] is of a magical suspension of time and movement—even of the laws of gravity ... the figure seems to float weightlessly upon the enamel smoothness of the surface, exerting only the most delicate pressure, and the gravitational expectations of the heaviest earthbound forms are surprisingly controverted.""[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3212142,"The Ray (French: La raie) is a still life painting by Jean Simeon Chardin, first exhibited at the Exposition de la Jeunesse [fr] on 3 June 1728, and long held by the Louvre in Paris.

On 3 June 1728, the painting was first shown at the Exposition de la Jeunesse [fr], a free open air exhibition held for a few hours at the corner of the Place Dauphine and the Pont Neuf each year on the day of Corpus Christi (but postponed in the event of rain to Sunday after the end of the octave, Little Corpus Christi or Petite Fête-Dieu).
On 25 September 1728, Simeon Chardin exhibited the painting and The Buffet as his reception pieces to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture.[2] Both works remained with the Academy until the French Revolution, when they were moved to the new Muséum Central des Arts, now the Louvre.

Chardin depicts the bloody underside of a skate, gutted and hanging from a hook on the stone wall. The fish lies above a shelf on which there are various domestic items to the right on a white cloth: two metal pans, a ceramic jug, a bottle and a knife. Below the skate are two other fish, and further to the left are some opened oysters and a cat with an arched back and raised fur, as if frightened by the sight. The composition can be analysed as a series of pyramids, with the pointed skate in the centre, the jug and other inanimate objects to the right, and the cat and oysters to the left. The handle of the knife hanging off the ledge and the corner of the stone wall leading past the cat away from the viewer, adds depth to the scene.

Chardin was influenced by the Dutch still life paintings of the 17th century: the scene has been compared to Rembrandt's painting of the Slaughtered Ox. Although described by Diderot as ""'disgusting"", the peculiar but realistic composition was admired by other artists, including Matisse. Marcel Proust likened the image of the eponymous ray to the ""nave of a polychromatic cathedral.""[3]

As is often the case in Chardin's still lifes, the subject is not essential but the support for pictorial research, an exercise in style on light, reflections and textures. Chardin practiced painting for painting's sake before his time, as a precursor to the research of the end of the 19th century.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2415259,"St. Michael is an oil painting by Italian artist Raphael. Also called the Little St. Michael to distinguish it from a larger, later treatment of the same theme, St. Michael Vanquishing Satan, it is now in the Louvre in Paris.[1] The work depicts the Archangel Michael in combat with the demons of Hell, while the damned suffer behind him. Along with St. George, it represents the first of Raphael's works on martial subjects.[2]

An early work of the artist, the painting was executed for Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, in 1504 or 1505 on the back of a draughtboard, possibly commissioned to express appreciation to Louis XII of France for conferring the Order of Saint Michael on Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Guidobaldo's nephew and heir.[3] Whatever the impetus for its creation, by 1548 it hung in the collection at the Palace of Fontainebleau.

In 2006's Early Work of Raphael, Julia Cartwright suggests it may betray the influence of Timoteo Viti in the gold tinting to the green wings of Michael, while the sinners in the background suggest that Raphael may have consulted an illustrated volume of Dante's Inferno.[3] The punishments depicted reflect Dante's treatment of hypocrites and thieves.[4]

A little more than a decade after completing the little St. Michael, Raphael was commissioned to revisit the theme, producing St. Michael Vanquishing Satan for Pope Leo X in 1518.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21121925,"Napoleon I as Emperor, also known as Napoleon I in his Coronation Robes (French: Portrait de l’empereur Napoléon Ier en robe de sacre), is an oil on canvas painting by the French artist François Gérard, produced in 1805 under the First French Empire and currently displayed at the Palace of Versailles. Gérard initially produced the painting as an official portrait of Napoleon I for his throne room at the Tuileries Palace. It was later moved to the Palace of Versailles. The painting spent time at the Louvre, at the Élysée Palace (from 1849 to 1851 under the presidency of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte), then at the Château de Saint-Cloud before returning to Versailles in 1894.

The painting depicts the emperor Napoleon I at his coronation on 2 December 1804.  He is standing before a blue-cushioned gilt throne, wearing a white robe embroidered with gold thread, a long red coronation cloak [fr] trimmed with ermine, and white coronation gloves [fr].  His head is crowned with golden laurels, and he is wearing a golden collar of the Légion d'honneur.  He is holding a staff topped by an eagle in his right hand, and his left hand is resting by his side; further to his right is a stool bearing an orb and cross and an ivory-headed sceptre, a Hand of Justice [fr] typical of the French Crown Jewels. 

The work measures 225.5 cm × 145.5 cm (88.8 in × 57.3 in) – with its frame, 261.5 cm × 180.5 cm × 17.5 cm (103.0 in × 71.1 in × 6.9 in) – and weighs 100 kg (220 lb).  Many copies were produced during the First French Empire.  There are workshop paintings at, for example, the Château de Fontainebleau in Fontainebleau, the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (on loan from the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen since 1922), the  Pushkin Museum in Moscow, the Hofburg in Vienna, and the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin.

A copy is now in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples, probably after being taken there by Joachim Murat, although it is not known where it was first exhibited.[1] When the Bourbons were restored to the throne of Naples, the painting was initially moved off public display and into a barn at the Palace of Portici. The work was attributed to Gérard in the 1840s and the work was moved to the main floor of the palace.[1] In an 1874 inventory, the work was reattributed to Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson[1] and moved to the Palace of Capodimonte, where it still hangs in Room 54 within the Royal Apartments.[2]

Despite being a copy, the work has several notable differences to the original. In the copy, the figure's pose is modelled on that of Michaelangelo's David, standing with the sceptre of Charles V of France in one hand and a gold laurel wreath on his head. To his left is a cushion bearing the hand of justice and an orb, whilst there is a throne in the background. The work's celebratory tone is reinforced by a French-made frame surmounted by emblems of Napoleon.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6034865,"Saint Louis is a 1592–1595 painting by El Greco, painted during his time in Toledo. It is now in the Louvre in Paris.

It shows Louis IX of France wearing 16th-century armour and a crown and holding his family symbol of a fleur de lys and the traditional sceptre of the kings of France. Gregorio Marañon and Manuel Bartolomé Cossío argue the model was a patient at the Hospital del Nuncio or an old print. 

Louis was the grandson of Alfonso VIII of Castile, meaning that in the late 16th century, he was revered in both France and Spain, particularly since no Spanish king was canonised until Ferdinand III of Castile received the honour in 1671. The work was commissioned by Luis de Castilla, the painter's friend and future executor – the saint was also Luis' name saint. For a period the work was in the collection of the château de Chenonceau, before being acquired by its present owner in 1903. A recent restoration has revealed a cityscape in the background, showing Toledo.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7571529,"Souvenir de Mortefontaine (Recollection of Mortefontaine) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, created in 1864. It is a scene of tranquillity: a woman and children quietly enjoying themselves by a glass-flat, tree-flanked lake.

Generally acknowledged as one of his masterpieces, it is among the most successful of Corot's later, more poetic works. The painting captures an idealized scene while still drawing from the real world. Corot's early painting showed Realist leanings, but as his career progressed he began to combine more Romantic elements, and his works are often viewed as a bridge between Realism and the evolving Impressionist movement. Souvenir de Mortefontaine verges on the Impressionistic, with the lake and landscape captured by broad rather than detailed strokes and Corot's careful attention to the play of light within the scene, though the brushwork is precise and the painting has a more muted palette than the bright colours favoured by the Impressionists. The indistinct features are reminiscent of the blurry details of early landscape photography; Corot had a large collection of these photographs and may have been attempting to recreate the effect in paint.

Mortefontaine is a small village in the Oise département in northern France. Corot made frequent visits to the area in the 1850s to study the effects of light and reflection on water. In Souvenir de Mortefontaine Corot was not producing a scene from life, but (as the title suggests) his recollections of his visits and the play of light on the ponds in the village. Corot produced a second similar painting, The Boatman of Mortefontaine (1865–70), which shows the same lake and trees from the same perspective. Changes in the features of the landscape in The Boatman from those depicted in Souvenir hint at the paintings being generalised impressions rather than details captured from life.

Souvenir de Mortefontaine was purchased in 1864 for the French state directly from Corot through Napoleon III's Civil List, and after hanging at Fontainebleau for 25 years it was transferred to the Louvre in 1889.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3503317,"The Duel After the Masquerade is a painting by the French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme, of which multiple copies exist. The original, Suite d'un bal masqué, first shown in 1857, is in the Musée Condé in Chantilly, France.

Gérôme exhibited Suite d'un bal masqué at the Paris Salon of 1857, then in London the same year with the English merchant Gambart. The painting became famous almost overnight with critics of the Salon speculating about Gerome's sources for the incident depicted in the painting.[1] (The theme seems to have been in fashion; Thomas Couture dealt with the same subject in 1857 with  Le Duel après le bal masqué, now in the Wallace Collection). The painting was acquired in 1858 by the duc d'Aumale. Gérôme borrowed the painting to present it at the Universal Exhibition of 1867, and received the Grand Prix de Peinture. The original is part of the collection of the Musée Condé in Chantilly, France.[2]

In 1859, William Thompson Walters purchased The Duel After the Masquerade at the National Academy of Design in New York for $2,500.[3]: 17  The painting is a replica by Gérôme of his 1857 work Suite d'un bal masqué.  It was not unusual for artists to replicate their own paintings; Gérôme also painted versions for Prince Alexander of Russia (now in the Hermitage Museum) and for the Ali Pacha.  Walters asked the manager of the exhibition at the National Academy of Design for a letter of authentication from Gérôme and a comparison of his copy to the original.[3]: 241 

In a poll taken in the winter of 1909–1910, Baltimoreans were asked to identify their fifty-five favorite works of art, and  The Duel After the Masquerade topped the list.[3]: 183 

The scene is set on a gray winter morning in the Bois de Boulogne, trees bare and snow covering the ground.  A man dressed as a Pierrot has been mortally wounded in a duel and has collapsed into the arms of a Duc de Guise.  A surgeon, dressed as a doge of Venice, tries to stop the flow of blood, while a Domino clutches his own head.

The survivor of the duel, dressed as an American Indian, walks away with his second, Harlequin, leaving behind his weapon and some feathers of his headdress, towards his carriage, shown waiting in the background.

It was characteristic of Gérôme to depict not a violent event itself, but the aftermath of such violence; see The Death of Caesar, The Execution of Marshal Ney, and Jerusalem. The bizarreness of the scene in regard to the brightly colored costumes turns to pathos at the sight of blood on the Pierrot.[1]

The Walters indicates that the work has been included in the following exhibitions:[4]

Madame Rivière, born Marie-Françoise-Jacquette-Bibiane Blot de Beauregard, and known as Sabine, married Philibert Rivière de L'Isle, an influential court official in the Napoleonic Empire,[2] who commissioned this work, along with portraits of himself and their daughter, Caroline.[3]

The painting is composed from white, chilly blue, beige and ochre colours. It has an overall, deliberately flat and shadow-less appearance.[4] The portrait has been described as having ""an ambiance of female voluptuousness, [and] pampered femininity"".[1] Seated on a blue cushion or sofa, Sabine, then in her mid-30s, wears a low-cut and wide necked prom dress, with a high waist and short sleeves, a cream colored chiffon, and a cashmere shawl.[5] He black hair is arranged in curls. The painting shocked critics when exhibited at the 1808 Salon, particularly they were perplexed at the illogical and unnatural anatomy.[6] A point of focus was her deliberately elongated right arm. The technique however was to become a hallmark on Ingres' female portraits, in this case the arm is lengthened to rhyme with the curve of the oval frame.[2]

There has been speculation as to why their son Paul was not portrayed and the background to the commission is unclear. Philibert Rivière was likely impressed by the painter's 1804 Bonaparte, First Consul; his own portrait echoes the emperor's pose.[4] Unusually for Ingres, no preparatory drawings are known.[4] Ingres' never saw the three Rivière paintings after the 1808 Salon, he tried to find and reunite them for an 1855 exhibition, but all the sitters had died (Caroline in 1807, Philibert in 1816, and Sabine in 1848), and could not determine the location of the canvasses. As it turned out they had been in the Paris collection of Paul Rivière. They were eventually bequeathed to the nation in 1870, three years after Ingres' own death.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24213,"The Tree of Crows (also known as Raven Tree) is an oil painting of 1822 by the German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich. Acquired by the Musée du Louvre in 1975 (its first by the artist, followed by Seaside by Moonlight in 2000), it has been called one of Friedrich's ""most compelling paintings.""[1] The painting depicts a twisted oak tree, bare but for a few dead leaves, seen against an evening sky. An inscription on the back of the canvas refers to the hill at the painting's center as a Hünengrab, or dolmen, a prehistoric burial ground.[2][3] In the distance can be seen the ocean, and Cape Arkona's chalk cliffs, a favorite subject of Friedrich's.[2] Two crows are perched on the oak, while a flock (also known, more correctly, as a ""murder"") descends toward it. In the darkened foreground are a hacked trunk and the upright stump of another oak.

The oak is based on a drawing dated 3 May 1809, to which Friedrich added branches at the left and elongated others so as to stretch its forms across the picture plane; the tree in the painting has the overall shape of a rhombus, its web of contorted branches taking on a dramatic presence.[4] Contrasted with the serene layers of chromatic clouds, the tree's forms have been likened to ""many flailing arms.""[5] The foreground may be seen as representing death, with the distant sky offering consoling beauty and the promise of redemption after life.[3][5]

A single dominant oak was also the subject of two later vertical compositions painted by Friedrich. In those paintings the trees appear to stand in resignation, whereas that of The Tree of Crows seems animated by desperation.[5]

The surface displayed within the frame is 331 cm by 245.5 cm. In late 2022 it was not on display.[1]

It was the main element in an altarpiece that is now dispersed. Four small predella panels now in other collections have been connected by art historians with the piece. These are now in a private collection in Scotland, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the John G. Johnson Collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.[2]

Signorelli was born in the town of Cortona in Tuscany, about 20 kilometres from Città di Castello in Umbria.[3] In his early 40s he had returned to live in Cortona, after working in Florence, Siena and Rome (1478–1484, painting a now lost section of the Sistine Chapel). With an established reputation, he remained based in Cortona for the rest of his life, but often travelled to the cities of the region to fulfill commissions. This altarpiece comes a few years before the large set of frescos in Orvieto Cathedral which have always been regarded as his masterpiece.  Probably trained by Piero della Francesca in Florence, as his cousin Giorgio Vasari wrote, his Quattrocento style was about to become rather out of date over the following years.[4] The earliest documented painting by the young Raphael was the Baronci Altarpiece (1500–1501) for the same church for which this altarpiece was painted; this was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1789, and only fragments survive.[5]

In contrast to many of Signorelli's paintings, the scene is tranquil and rather static, with attention focused on the principal figures who are lined up across the foreground of the picture space. The three Biblical Magi (or Three Kings) are, as was usual, differentiated by age and race, although their names, ages and races are not consistent.[6] The black king is most often a young figure, but here the king at the left is white and blond-haired, the kneeling one in the centre in his prime, and the king at right has a dark complexion, though hardly any darker than that of Saint Joseph with whom he is talking.

Though most art historians now attribute the painting to Signorelli, with assistance from his workshop team, some in the past thought that he had only designed or underdrawn the composition, leaving the painting to his team.[7] Maud Cruttwell, in the first monograph in English, published in 1899, following Crowe and Cavalcaselle, thought he had done the ""drawing only"".[8] She bases this in part on the ""impressive dignity"" of the main figures, but also from what she regards as the tell-tale ""badly-drawn horses ... for it will be noticed all through his work that he has never cared to thoroughly master their form, and paints them always with curious mannerisms of too closely-placed nostrils, and human eyebrows, which show how little attention he had given to their anatomy.""[9]

At least later in his career, Signorelli sometimes did the drawn cartoon for the main section of altarpieces, but left the painting to his workshop. But he might paint the small predella panels himself, as is thought to have been the case for a work of 1521.[10]

The National Gallery of Art in Washington has a Marriage of the Virgin,[11] and Philadelphia an Annunciation,[12] and in Richmond, Virginia, there is a Presentation of the Virgin.[13] The panel the Louvre says is in a Scottish private collection perhaps belongs to Robert Lindsay, 29th Earl of Crawford; Cruttwell listed Lord Crawford's collection in London as having two Signorelli predella parts: ""1. Meeting of Joachim and Anna. 2. Birth of the Virgin"".[14]

It is not clear when the predella panels were separated from the main scene.  They first went to a smaller church on Cortona, and by 1819 were in a private collection there.[15]

The altarpiece was perhaps commissioned by Vitellozzo Vitelli,[16] who like his father Niccolò Vitelli (d. 1486) was a condottiero and ruler of the town. Signorelli painted portraits of both of them. A few years later Vitellozzo fell out with Cesare Borgia, who had him strangled in 1502, after which the town was taken into the Papal States.

The main panel was still in the monastery in 1617. After an earthquake in 1789 it was probably sold to Pope Pius VI; it is recorded in his family's Palazzo Braschi in Rome in 1838. At some point thereafter it passed to the Campana collection in Rome (as Campana 245), then after Giampietro Campana's bankruptcy and imprisonment for fraud it was sequestered with the rest of the collection by the Papal government in 1861, who arranged to sell it to the Louvre; it entered their collection in 1863 (as MI 540).[17]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12116031,"Portrait of a Woman is an oil-on-canvas portrait of an unknown woman, now attributed to the Italian artist Dosso Dossi, painted ca. 1530–1535. It is now in the Musée Condé.

It is first definitively recorded in the inventory of the collections of the Palazzo della Pilotta in Parma in 1708, meaning it originated in the Farnese collection, which had been in the Palazzo del Giardino in Parma since at least 1680. It was probably acquired by the Farnese family as a result of confiscations early in the 17th century. The whole Farnese collection was sent to Naples in 1734 after Charles of Bourbon's accession as king of Naples. He had inherited it from his mother Elisabeth Farnese, wife of Philip V of Spain. The work was inherited by Leopold, Prince of Salerno, son of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. In 1854 Leopold's collection was sold in its entirety to his nephew Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale, then in exile in Britain - Portrait was then still attributed to Romano. He brought it to France in 1871 and hung it in his château de Chantilly.

The current attribution was first mooted in 1932 by Bernard Berenson, though Felton Gibbons's monograph on the painter preferred to see it as a studio copy after a lost autograph original - Gibbons also argued it was a pendant to Portrait of a Man (Fitzwilliam Museum). Portrait of a Woman was restored in 1984, showing much retouching, restoring the original colours and confirming it as an autograph Dossi work. The very linear eye is characteristic of the painter and can also be seen in his Portrait of a Man with Five Rings (Royal Collection, Hampton Court) and Portrait of a Soldier (Fogg Art Museum). The treatment of costume details is also reminiscent of the women in Dossi's Allegory of Hercules (Uffizi) and Portrait of a Man (Louvre).

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3225258,"The Parnassus is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna, executed in 1497. It is housed in the Musée du Louvre of Paris.

The Parnassus was the first picture painted by Mantegna for Isabella d'Este's studiolo (cabinet) in the Ducal Palace of Mantua. The shipping of the paint used by Mantegna for the work is documented in 1497; there is also a letter to Isabella (who was at Ferrara) informing her that once back she would find the work completed.

The theme was suggested by the court poet Paride da Ceresara. After Mantegna's death in 1506, the work was partially repainted to update it to the oil technique which had become predominant. The intervention was due perhaps to Lorenzo Leonbruno, and regarded the heads of the Muses, of Apollo, Venus and the landscape.

Together with the other paintings in the studiolo, it was given to Cardinal Richelieu by Duke Charles I of Mantua in 1627, entering the royal collections with Louis XIV of France. Later it became part of the Louvre Museum.

The traditional interpretation of the work is based on a late 15th-century poem by Battista Fiera, which identified it as a representation of Mount Parnassus, culminating in the allegory of Isabella  as Venus and Francesco II Gonzaga as Mars.

The two gods are shown on a natural arch of rocks in front a symbolic bed; in the background the vegetation has many fruits in the right part (the male one) and only one in the left (female) part, symbolizing the fecundation. The posture of Venus derives from the ancient sculpture. They are accompanied by Anteros (the heavenly love), opposed to the carnal one. The latter is still holding the arch, and has a blowpipe which aims at the genitals of Vulcan, Venus' husband, portrayed in his workshop in a grotto. Behind him is the grape, perhaps a symbol of the drunk's intemperance.

In a clearing under the arch is Apollo playing a lyre. Nine Muses are dancing, in an allegory of universal harmony. The touch of Pegasus's hoof (right) can generate the spring which fed the falls of Mount Helicon, which can be seen in the background. The Muses danced traditionally in wood of this mount, and thus the traditional naming of Mount Parnassus is wrong.

Near Pegasus is Mercury, with his traditional winged hat, caduceus (the winged staff with entwined snakes), and messenger shoes. He is present to protect the two adulterers.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5817081,"Echo and Narcissus is an oil painting of 1627 and 1628 by French artist Nicolas Poussin. It measures 74 by 100 cm (29 by 39 in) and is kept in the Louvre, Paris.

The work derives from Greek Mythology. According to Ovid's Metamorphoses, the nymph Echo fell in love with Narcissus, but he rejected her. Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, punished Narcissus by making him fall in love with his own reflection.

At the place where he died grew the flower that bears his name: Narcissus.

Poussin illustrates this myth by representing three characters in an idyllic landscape: in the foreground, Narcissus, lying down; behind him, on the right, Eros, god of love; and on the left, sitting on a rock, Echo. Around the hair of young Narcissus are already blooming flowers to which he gave his name. Echo, leaning on a rock, seems ""an elegiac and immaterial apparition"".[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q63536638,"Aurora and Cephalus is a 1733 oil-on-canvas painting by François Boucher, signed by the artist and now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nancy.[1] It shows Cephalus and Aurora (the Roman form of Eos) from Book VII of Ovid's Metamorphoses.

Boucher produced it after his return from Italy and it was commissioned by François Derbais, advocate to the Parliament of Paris, for his hôtel particulier on rue de la Poissonnière in Paris, as a pendant to Venus Asking Vulcan for Weapons for Aeneas (1732, Louvre). Derbais' descendants sold both works, which came back on the market together in the posthumous sale of Watelet's collection on 12 June 1786. They were bought by Paillet for the French royal collection in the Louvre for 3121 livres.[2]

In 1801, while the Louvre was known as the Central Museum of Arts, Aurora and Cephalus was one of thirty works it selected to decorate the Château de Lunéville for the signing of the Treaty of Lunéville between France and Austria. At the request of the Meurthe département the Boucher and twelve other paintings were permanently placed in the museum at Nancy even before the passing of the décret Chaptal on 1 September 1801, seen as the foundation date for France's regional museums.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q737062,"Olympia is a painting by Édouard Manet, first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon, which shows a nude woman (""Olympia"") lying on a bed being brought flowers by a servant. Olympia was modelled by Victorine Meurent and Olympia's servant by the art model Laure. Olympia's confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute. The French government acquired the painting in 1890 after a public subscription organized by Claude Monet. The painting is on display at the Musée d'Orsay, Paris.

The title of the painting is generally credited to Manet's close friend, the art critic and artist Zacharie Astruc, since an excerpt from an Astruc poem was included in the catalogue entry with the piece when it was exhibited at the 1865 Salon.[1]

What shocked contemporary audiences was not Olympia's nudity, nor the presence of her fully clothed maid, but her confrontational gaze and a number of details identifying her as a demi-mondaine or prostitute.[2] These include the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings and the oriental shawl on which she lies, symbols of wealth and sensuality. The black ribbon around her neck, in stark contrast with her pale flesh, and her cast-off slipper underline the voluptuous atmosphere. ""Olympia"" was a name associated with prostitutes in 1860s Paris.[3]

The painting is modelled after Titian's Venus of Urbino (c. 1534).[4] Whereas the left hand of Titian's Venus is curled and appears to entice, Olympia's left hand appears to block, which has been interpreted as symbolic of her role as a prostitute, granting or restricting access to her body in return for payment.[5] Manet replaced the little dog (symbol of fidelity) in Titian's painting with a black cat, a creature associated with nocturnal promiscuity.[5] The aroused posture of the cat was provocative; in French, chatte (cat) is slang for female genitalia.[6] Olympia disdainfully ignores the flowers presented to her by her servant, probably a gift from a client.[6] Some have suggested that she is looking in the direction of the door, as her client barges in unannounced.[6]

The painting deviates from the academic canon in its style, characterized by broad, quick brushstrokes, studio lighting that eliminates mid-tones, large color surfaces and shallow depth. Unlike the smooth idealized nude of Alexandre Cabanel's La naissance de Vénus, also painted in 1863, Olympia is a real woman whose nakedness is emphasized by the harsh lighting.[2] The canvas alone is 	130.5 × 190 cm (51.4 × 74.8 inches), which is rather large. Most paintings that were this size depicted historical or mythological events, so the size of the work, among other factors, caused surprise. Finally, Olympia is fairly thin by the artistic standards of the time. Charles Baudelaire thought thinness was more indecent than fatness.[7]

The model for Olympia, Victorine Meurent, would have been recognized by viewers of the painting because she was well known in Paris circles.  She started modeling when she was sixteen years old and she also was an accomplished painter in her own right.[8] Some of her paintings were exhibited in the Paris Salon. The familiarity with the identity of the model was a major reason this painting was considered shocking to viewers.  A well known woman currently living in modern-day Paris could not simultaneously represent a historical or mythological woman.[9]

Though Manet's The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) sparked controversy in 1863, his Olympia stirred an even bigger uproar when it was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon. Conservatives condemned the work as ""immoral"" and ""vulgar"".[2] Journalist Antonin Proust later recalled, ""If the canvas of the Olympia was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions that were taken by the administration."" The critics and the public condemned the work alike. Even Émile Zola was reduced to disingenuously commenting on the work's formal qualities rather than acknowledging the subject matter, ""You wanted a nude, and you chose Olympia, the first that came along"".[10] He paid tribute to Manet's honesty, however: ""When our artists give us Venuses, they correct nature, they lie. Édouard Manet asked himself why lie, why not tell the truth; he introduced us to Olympia, this fille of our time, whom you meet on the sidewalks.""[11]

Although originally overlooked, the figure of the maid in the painting, modelled by a woman named Laure, has become a topic of discussion among contemporary scholars. As T. J. Clark recounts of a friend's disbelief in the revised 1990 version of The Painting of Modern Life: ""you've written about the white woman on the bed for fifty pages and more, and hardly mentioned the black woman alongside her.""[12] Olympia was created 15 years after slavery had been abolished in France and its empire, but negative stereotypes of black people persisted among some elements of French society. In some cases, the white prostitute in the painting was described using racially charged language. According to Maria Rutledge, ""references to Blackness thus invaded the image of white Olympia, turning her into the caricatural and grotesque animal that Black people are frequently made to represent in the nineteenth century.""[13]

Many critics have applauded Manet in his use of white and black in the painting, an alternative to the tradition of chiaroscuro. Charles Bernheimer has responded,

The black maid is not ... simply a darkly colored counterpart to Olympia's whiteness, but rather an emblem of the dark, threatening, anomalous sexuality lurking just under Olympia's hand. At least, this is the fantasy Manet's servant figure may well have aroused in the male spectator of 1865.[14]
According to Timothy Paul, some black feminists, including Lorraine O' Grady, have argued that it is not for artistic convention that Manet included Laure but to create an ideological binary between black and white, good and bad, clean and dirty and as such ""inevitably reformulates the Cartesian perspectival logic that allows whiteness to function as the only subject of consideration"".[15] When paired with a lighter skin tone, the Black female model stands in as signifier to all of the racial stereotypes of the West.

In Lorraine O'Grady's essay titled ""Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity"",[16] she asserts, ""Olympia's maid, like all other 'peripheral Negroes'"", is a robot conveniently made to disappear into the background drapery. While the confrontational gaze of Olympia is often referenced as the pinnacle of defiance toward patriarchy, the oppositional gaze of Olympia's maid is ignored; she is part of the background with little to no attention given to the critical role of her presence.

O'Grady points out that we know she represents 'Jezebel and Mammy' ""and best of all, she is not a real person"", rather she is object to the objectified and excluded from sexual difference according to Freudian theory.[16] While Olympia looks directly at the viewer, her maid, too, is looking back.[17] In her essay ""Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and Their Homegirls: Developing an Oppositional Gaze toward the Images of Black Women"", Catherine West concludes that by claiming an oppositional gaze we can identify, criticize, resist and transform these and other oppressive images of Black women.[18]

In January 2016, a Luxembourg performance artist, Deborah De Robertis, lay on the floor in front of the painting nude and mimicked the pose of the subject. She was arrested for indecent exposure.[19]

In part, the painting was inspired by Titian's Venus of Urbino (c. 1534), which in turn derives from Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510). The Titian has two fully clothed women, presumably servants, in the background. Léonce Bénédite was the first art historian to explicitly acknowledge the similarity to the Venus of Urbino in 1897.[20] There is also some similarity to Francisco Goya's La maja desnuda (c. 1800).[21]

There were also pictorial precedents for a nude white female, often pictured with a black female servant, such as Léon Benouville's Esther with Odalisque (1844), Ingres' Odalisque with a Slave (1842), and Charles Jalabert's Odalisque (1842).[22] Comparison is also made to Ingres' Grande Odalisque (1814).  Manet did not depict a goddess or an odalisque but a high-class prostitute waiting for a client; it has often been argued that Titian did the same.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3842437,"The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Four Saints is an oil painting on panel by Pontormo in the Louvre, Paris. References in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists are taken by some to date the work to 1528–1529, the years immediately after Pontormo painted the Capponi Chapel. More recent art historians argue that its style is close to works he produced between 1524 and 1526.[1]

The work was produced for the monastery of Sant'Anna in Verzaia outside Florence's Porta San Frediano, hence the presence of Saint Anne. From left to right the other saints are Sebastian in green, Peter in saffron and blue, the Good Thief, and Benedict of Nursia in a monk's habit. Until 1370 the monastery's church was the halfway point of a procession on Saint Anne's feast day (26 July) to commemorate the city's ""liberation"" from the Duke of Athens. The medallion at the foot of the Madonna's throne shows a group of people from the procession, including an infantry captain (the work's commissioner), the heads of companies, trumpeters, pipers, dealers, ""commanders"" and ""benchers"".

The monastery was destroyed during the 1529 Siege of Florence and the work was in the Ospedale Sant'Eusebio al Prato in the western part of Florence's historic city centre by 1813, when it was looted by Napoleon and taken to Paris. It was first exhibited at the Louvre in 1814 and not returned to Florence after the end of the Napoleonic Wars.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5966403,"The Cradle  is an oil on canvas painting by the French Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot, executed in 1872. It is on display at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[1]

Morisot represented in this painting her sister Edma Portillon watching over the sleep of her daughter Blanche. The painting was exhibited for the first time in the first impressionist exhibition, opened on April 15, 1874, in the former studio of the photographer Nadar, on the Parisian Boulevard des Capucines. Although some critics praised the painting, it did not attract much interest and Morisot failed to sell it. Morisot had set the price at 800 francs.[2] The work remained subsequently in the family collection, passing into the hands of Blanche Portillon, the painter's niece and model of the sleeping baby. In 1930 it was acquired by the Louvre Museum. Between 1947 and 1986, it was exhibited at the Jeu de Paume, located in the Jardin des Tuileries and owned by the Louvre, where the main works of impressionism were brought together. After the creation of the Musée d'Orsay, it was moved there.[3]

The current painting constitutes the first representation of the theme of motherhood in Morisot's work, which the artist would later regularly cultivated. The canvas reveals the influence of Édouard Manet, a painter whom Morisot had met at the Louvre in 1868 and whose brother Eugène Manet she would marry in 1874. The composition of the painting is based on the diagonal formed by the gaze of the mother towards her sleeping daughter and the fabric of the crib in which she sleeps. The diagonal is reinforced by the left bent arm of the mother, to which the small arm, also bent, of the baby responds.[4]

Morisot uses in this painting a reduced number of colors and a fluid brushstroke. The painting reflects an atmosphere of great intimacy, sweetness and protective love. This canvas, together with others like the one Claude Monet made of his son, Jean Monet at his Cradle (1867), attempt a new representation of childhood.

Regarding the title, The Cradle, when comparing it with other paintings that represented sleeping children also exhibited at the Official Salon, Dominique Lobstein states that ""before perhaps contributing to an aesthetic revolution, this painting participates in a rhetorical evolution: Morisot abandons all anecdotal picturesqueness and the title take on a tasteful simplicity, intended to immediately inform the viewer of the content of the work and allow him to project himself as in his own daily life"".[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3686086,"The Pastoral Concert or Le Concert Champêtre is an oil painting of c. 1509 attributed to the Italian Renaissance master Titian.[1] It was previously attributed to his fellow Venetian and contemporary Giorgione. It is now in the Musée du Louvre in Paris.[2]

This painting was created between approximately 1509 and 1510; the exact date of its creation is unknown.[3] This period also represents a turbulent period of history in Venice, specifically the League of Cambrai's War in 1509.[4] Art historian Jonathan Unglaub suggests that this painting was painted in response to the war, providing an ""idyllic refuge from the ravages of history.""[4]

The term ""Concert Champêtre"" was first used in 1754 by Nicolas Bernard Lépicié, to describe this painting. But when it entered the Louvre in 1792 it was given the title of a Fête champêtre, a genre arguably based on this painting. It is believed to visually show the Renaissance admiration of classical poetry, an essential value of humanism.[5] This painting is also considered the origin of a particular genre of Pastoral paintings, because of its connection to pastoral poetry, as seen by the young men gathering in the Italian countryside's lush, picturesque greenery.[5] The pastoral concert or Fête Champêtre genre is described as a gathering in a picturesque landscape. Usually, young men are gathered together in a creative pursuit, seated on the landscape's grass. The paintings themselves are almost always allegories or depictions of mythological characters.[2]  This is the 16th-century genre; in the French-led 18th-century type, women are very prominent.

This painting is an example of the Venetian school of Italian Renaissance art. Paintings from Venice are characterized as having rich color schemes that create a ""warm glow"" and emphasize naturalism above all else. Venetian paintings also have a specialty in mythological and allegorical themes. The unique use of color is known as colorito, and it was most often found in Venetian painting.[6]

The patronage of this painting remains unknown today. Isabella d'Este is a possible candidate for patron due to a so-called bagno scene she commissioned for her brother Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. Still, the word bagno is now considered to describe a painting by Palma Vecchio, another Venetian painter active during the same period.[7]

The painting portrays three young people on a lawn, playing music together. Next to them, a standing woman is pouring water from a marble basin. The women are naked apart from their drapery, fallen to their legs; the two men are dressed in contemporary 16th century Venetian costume. In a vast, pastoral background, there is a shepherd and a landscape.

As is usual with early Venetian paintings, there are no drawings that are clearly associated with this painting, but some figure drawings may have been used as sources for individual figures. These probably come from the circle of Giorgione, as does the painter.[8]

It has been suggested that the painting may be a commentary on the paragone, the scholarly debate during the Renaissance that tried to determine either painting or sculpture as the superior art form.[9][10] Venice was one of the artistic epicenters of the paragone between the concepts disegno and colorito, with the latter being a hallmark of Venetian Art.[10] It is proposed that this painting could be an artistic argument, showing how painting and the techniques of colorito are superior to disegno, which was common to Florentine art. Some of the most well known colorito artists from the Venetian Renaissance include Giorgione, Titian, Giovanni Bellini, and Jacopo Bellini.[10]

The painting is understood to be a pastoral landscape in the Italian countryside. It is not explicitly stated or described by historical documents exactly where this painting is set. Still, as it comes from Venice, there is a high possibility in the Venetian countryside.[4] Venetian painting's major specialty is landscape paintings, specifically idyllic landscapes such as Locus amoenus that posit subjects into the Venetian Countryside. This painting shows a meadow with a landscape that has broad slopes down to a water source. Intermixed with this idyllic landscape with buildings that match the typical town/villa style of the 16th century Venice city-state.[11]

Christiane Joost-Gaugier suggests that the painting's landscape was a fictional setting inspired by Virgil's Eclogues, specifically numbers three and eight.[11] The painting's landscape details suggest this particular epilogue because the Shepard's appearance with bagpipes alludes to a possible scene depicting a singing contest of Theocritus from Horace's Ode or Vergil from Virgil's Eclogues (3,7).[11]

The subject was perhaps an allegory of poetry and music; the two women could be an imaginary apparition representing ideal beauty, stemming from the two men's fantasy and inspiration. The woman with the glass vase would be the muse of tragic poetry, while the other would be pastoral poetry. Of the two playing men, the one with the lute would represent the exalted lyric poetry, the other being an ordinary lyricist, according to Aristotle's distinction in his Poetics. Another interpretation suggests that the painting evokes the natural world's four elements (water, fire, earth, and air) and their harmonic relationship.[12]

Another theory is that this painting's subject is an allegorical interpretation of Theocritus's poem about Daphnis, a shepherd thought to be the pastoral poetry founder.[7] Philipp Fehl references this poem in his theory on the identity of the women in the paintings.[13] Theocritus describes Arcadia as the land that the Greek god Pan originates. Arcadia was imagined as a ""paradise"" by Jacopo Sannazaro in his 15th-century pastoral poem Arcadia, popular around Venice and the surrounding city-states. It is suggested that the nymphs create Arcadia around them, making Arcadia a spiritual state of existence that one establishes.[2]  Philipp Fehl also proposes that this painting symbolizes Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, an extremely popular epic poem in the early 16th century. One of Ariosto's most famous patrons was Ippolito d'Este and his older sister, Isabella d'Este, the possible patron of this painting.[13]

Julia Marianne Koos's theory suggests that the painting is an allegory for the discourse of love. In the Italian Renaissance, it was believed that nature was a ""mirror of the lover's soul and an idyllic place of refuge"".[9]  This specific painting's allegory on love's discourse was believed to be originating from Pietro Bembo's poetic musing on desire, such as his poem The Asolani. The concept of ""desire"" depicted in art was a heated debate in the 16th century, as seen in writings such as  Leonardo da Vinci's Trattato della pittura.[9]

Art Historian Ross Kilpatrick suggests that two ancient literature texts, Horace's Epistles and Propertius's Elegy, were the significant pieces of inspiration behind this painting.[11]

A leading theory on the women's identities in the painting was put forth by Phillipp Fehl in 1957, postulating that the women are Nymphs, minor ancient Greek goddesses, and not human. He stipulates that the nymphs have been lured out of the woods toward the music being created by the men in the pastoral. Fehl also maintains that these nymph women are invisible to the men in the painting but are visible to us, the viewer.[13] Also according to Fehl, the closest poetic work that matches this painting is William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (obviously, entirely unknown to Titian, as it was written much later) . He uses this passage from A Midsummer Night's Dream to support his theory of the nymphs being invisible to human eyes:

""But who comes here? I am invisible,
And I will overhear their conference.""
The use of nymphs from Ancient Greek mythology is common for Italian Renaissance paintings due to the deep appreciation for the antiquity of Greek and Rome, a common aspect of Renaissance Humanism.[13]

Holberton agrees they are nymphs from the woods enticed by the beauty of the music, but thinks they are visible to the men.[14]

Elhanian Motzkin identifies the nude female figure on the left as Inspiration and the right to be Euterpe, the Greek muse of music. In addition to identifying the female figures, Motzkin also put forth the identity of the men. Building off of the original theories of Phillipp Fehl, Motzkin identifies the men as Apollo and Paris, with Apollo teaching Paris how to play the lute.[11] He also posits that the formerly unidentified herdsman in the far right background is Paris' adoptive father. The latter raised him after being abandoned by his parents Priam and Hecuba.[4]

There are multiple uncertain issues in this painting, the most prominent being the female figure's inclusion on the left pouring water out of a clear jug into a well. Ross Kilpatrick theorized that while the identity of the woman on the left is unknown, the artist's inspiration may derive from Horace's Epistles, which places Horace in the Bandusian Spring's basin, a mystical body of water that also shows up in Propertius's work. The concept of a ""mystical spring"" presents itself in Epistles, referencing the Greek Muse Calliope. The town of the Sabine Villa included in Horace's Epistles 2.2 has a freshwater spring from which Calliope gathers water. In Horace's poem, the town itself has a fountain with the inscription: ""Bandusian Spring, more gleaming than glass."" Kirkpatrick suggests that this could be the inspiration for the inclusion of the figure pouring water.[11]

The attribution of this painting has long been the subject of debate. The artist was formerly believed to have been Giorgione. Later painting analysis suggested Titian, initially a follower of Giorgione, was its creator. There is no documentation demonstrating attribution. Christiane Joost Gaugier suggested Giorgione began the painting, but he died in 1511 before finishing the painting. He believes that Titian, Giorgione's protégé, completed the painting in honor of his departed mentor. Gaugier states that the lutenist in red on the left symbolizes a youthful Giorgione who is in the midst of teaching the rustic man the lute, a man understood to be a young Titian. Gaugier understands this painting as an allegory for the mentor – protégé relationship the two artists shared.[11]

The painting has also been attributed to Palma the Elder, Sebastiano del Piombo, Domenico Mancini, and Giovanni Bellini.[15][2] These theories, however, are not as common as the attribution to Titian or Giorgione due to a lack of historical evidence and restoration efforts. The theory of attribution to Domenico Mancini has gained ground as contextual evidence and historical documents have been analyzed.[2]

Pastoral Concert was attributed to Giorgione until the 20th century, mostly because Giorgione himself was included in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. While not explicitly named in the book, this passage is inferred: ""a musician who played the lute for musicians and continually enjoyed the pleasures of love."" This passage refers to the artist because the description matched so closely to the subject of this painting. A work known to have been painted by Giorgione, The Tempest, is referenced in Pastoral Concert through the use of colored hosiery worn by the male subjects, a symbol of Compagnie della Calza, an elite patrician order of young men.[7]

The painting was initially attributed to Giorgione, but modern critics assign as more likely a work of the younger Titian. The figures' robustness is considered more typical of his style.[16] Titian's painting The Adrians is used by Phillip Fehl to show the use of symbolic detail by Titian to credit this painting to Titian. Alfonso, I d'Este,  Duke of Ferrara, commissioned The Andrians, Isabella d'Este brother. Titian's connection to the House of Este family's patronage is seen as evidence of Titian being the creator of this painting.[13]

The painting itself fits closer to Titian's artistic style because of the artist's use of symbolic minute detail and Rubenesque bodies in the genre of Venetian painting.[2]

A theory postulated by Charles Hope, and endorsed by Holberton,[17] suggests that the author of the painting is Domenico Mancini, a contemporary painter and follower of Giorgione and Titian. Mancini's Lendinara Cathedral altarpiece is stylistically similar to Pastoral Concert, as well as his Madonna with Saints Francis and Roch. The latter painting is dated 1511, very close to the timeline of completion for this painting. As Hope observed, Pastoral Concert itself has not been cleaned. It is impossible to tell if the painting could be Mancini's without proper restoration.[2] As an artist, Mancini was known to borrow elements and mimic the style of certain Italian Masters. His painting Madonna with Saints Francis and Roch takes significant cues from Giovanni Bellini's San Zaccaria Altarpiece.[2]

The painting does not seem to have been well-known until the 18th century.[18]  The Gonzaga family, the lords of Mantua, an Italian city-state, owned the work. The painting was later sold to Charles I of England in about 1627, possibly acquired through Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, a close friend and courtier in Charles I's court.[19][3] When the English royal collections were dispersed following the revolution of 1649, the painting was sold at auction by the Commonwealth of England to the German banker and art collector, Eberhard Jabach. He, in turn, sold it to Jean-Baptiste Colbert on behalf of Louis XIV in 1671.[20][7] The painting was later owned in 1736 to Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, Marquise de Montespan's son, Duc d' Antin and his collection at the Palace of Versailles. After 1792, the painting was transferred from the French royal art collection to the Louvre Museum during the French Revolution. It remains in their collection to this day.[7][3]

Copies of this painting were widely available, mostly in Holland, and reproductions frequently were found in the Dutch Art Market in Amsterdam.[3]

The Dutch artist Jan de Bisschop copied Pastoral Concert for an engraving as part of his traditional practice copying the Italian Renaissance masters' art.[3] Eugène Delacroix was also said to have made a copy of this painting after witnessing it in the Louvre in 1824. The copy is now lost, but the Venetian work is rumored to have been one of the inspirations for his painting, Women of Algiers.[3] Some other artists' rumored to have copied Pastoral Concert include Edgar Degas and Henri Fantin-Latour.[3] Édouard Manet conceived his Le déjeuner sur l'herbe after viewing the earlier work in the Louvre.[12]

Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote a poem titled A Venetian Pastoral, by Giorgione, in the Louvre, which was explicitly written about this painting. His poetry was created to move the reader triangularly through the canvas, hopping from subject to subject. This specific sonnet was included in his Poems in 1870.[21]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3190681,"Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols  (French: Jéroboam sacrifiant aux idoles) is a history painting by the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, in oil on canvas.[1] It won him the highly prestigious Prix de Rome for painting on 26 August 1752, shortly after he turned 20 years old; this ""precocious triumph"" was even more remarkable as he had not received the usual training at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture.[2] The painted surface measures 111.5 by 143.5 centimetres (43.9 in × 56.5 in). It was retained by the Académie until that institution was abolished in the French Revolution and is now part of the collection of the successor Académie des Beaux-Arts.[3]

The subject had been chosen by the judges of the competition, and was the unusual but dramatic Old Testament subject of King Jeroboam in 1 Kings 12:26–30 and 13:1–5. This lay well outside the range of light-hearted Rococo scenes of pastoral romance, flirtation and erotic mythology that Fragonard was already developing at the studio of François Boucher. The moment depicted is when Jeroboam, at right in the white turban, is about to sacrifice to pagan idols, when an unnamed prophet (standing, at left) intercedes:[4]

When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, ""Seize him!"" But the hand he stretched out toward the man shrivelled up, so that he could not pull it back. Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the Lord.[5]
King Solomon Sacrificing to Idols, under the influence of his foreign wives, was a slightly more popular subject,[6] forming part of the Power of Women group.

Fragonard has adjusted his usual softer style to the requirements of history painting, less close to that of his master Boucher than those of Carle van Loo, with whom Fragonard was now to train, and Jean François de Troy, director of the French Academy in Rome, who had just died there in January 1752.[7]

Images using infrared photography show numerous pentimenti, especially in the area of the split altar in the centre of the painting, with ""its ashes poured out"", an unusual challenge for the painter to visualize, over which Fragonard evidently took much trouble.[8]

Despite having had a single owner since it was painted, the painting is now very well-travelled, having been included in exhibitions in Rome (1904), Moscow and Leningrad (1978), Kyoto (1980, Malibu (1982–83), Bayonne (1987), New York (1988), Tokyo (1989), Warsaw, Budapest and Bucharest (2004–05), Barcelona and Madrid (2006–07), Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Naples, Florida (2014–15), as well as many in Paris.[9]

The exact dating of the painting is uncertain, although it was not begun before 1580 and not finished after 1584. Its dimensions have previously been given as 162 × 190 cm (64 × 75 in) but are most recently given as 162 × 185 cm (64 × 73 in).[1][2]

The painting is the pendant of the Prado's Venus and Adonis. It is likewise a depiction of a tragic couple from Ovid's Metamorphoses: the painting depicts the moment where Procris expires, as her confused husband Cephalus tries both to understand her and to explain himself.[2]

Cephalus and Procris belonged to the Spanish royal collection from 1641 (when Diego Velázquez bought it in Venice) until at least 1809. It was one of the paintings taken from the collection by Joseph Bonaparte during his brief rule of Spain. It was sold several times after his death and finally bought for the museum by Wilhelm von Bode in Berlin in 1912.[1]

The Le Nain brothers, Antoine Le Nain (c.1600–1648), Louis Le Nain (c.1603–1648), and Mathieu Le Nain (1607–1677) produced genre works, portraits and portrait miniatures in 17th-century France. Because of the similarity of their styles of painting and the fact that they signed their paintings only with their surnames they are commonly referred to collectively as Le Nain.

This particular genre painting depicts three generations of a peasant family relaxing by the fireside round a table in the evening. Light coming from a window illuminates their faces and the folds of their simple clothes. By virtue of its size, quality and character it is considered one of the Le Nain's  masterpieces.

Corot began the painting on the motif in 1830, during the July Revolution which led him to flee Paris. He returned to it 42 years later, in 1872, when he enlarged the format with a relining and placed a character in the foreground.[citation needed]

The painting shows the west front of Chartres Cathedral bathed in a warm afternoon light that accentuates its luminosity. The cathedral, with clear and precise lines, has two juxtaposed spires, whose verticality is taken up by the two slender trees on the right, according to a balanced and coherent composition found also in other works by Corot.[citation needed]

In the scene depicted, there is a serene harmony between Nature and man-made elements: in front of the compact mass of the church, there are two grassy hills, at the foot of which is a pile of building materials. Nature also welcomes man: the characters that populate the scene are distinct, from the boy squatting on the square stone on the left to the carter in the background.[2][3][4]

The composition is divided into four planes, described respectively by the dusty road, the heap of building stones piled on the hill, the curtain of houses spread out along the road and the facade of the Gothic cathedral, which dominates the scene, rising into the sky. The scene is devoid of picturesque suggestions: everything appears random, and not even the Cathedral of Chartres has a prominent role over the other elements of the painting, with which it blends harmoniously.[5]

French novelist Marcel Proust mentions the painting in the first volume of his novel In Search of Lost Time. Proust considered Corot's painting ""as one of the eight paintings worthy of appearing in a French gallery of paintings at the Louvre in 1920"".

This work is inspired by the martyrdom of Saint Stephen which is recounted in Acts 7. This young deacon in the Christian community of Jerusalem was sentenced to death by stoning. The painting was influenced by the art of Caravaggio and Adam Elsheimer.[3] It represents the moment when Stephen was stoned outside the city by his many tormentors (about twenty characters), and he utters his last words to Christ as the light around him shows that the heavens are open.[4]

The painting is divided into two distinct zones with a diagonal creating an effect of chiaroscuro: on the left, a man on horseback is in the shadow, and on the right, Stephen and his persecutors are in the light. Saul of Tarsus can be seen seated in the background holding in his lap the coats of the stoners. Some inaccuracies in the drawing can be seen.[4] The character behind Stephen seems to be a self-portrait done into a wider composition, as Spanish painter Diego Velázquez did in Las Meninas.[5] John Durham suggests that Rembrandt ""presents himself as a somewhat alarmed presence, a participant who may be having second thoughts about what was taking place.""[6]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17305020,"Tanagra is a polychromic marble sculpture created by French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824-1904) as a personification of the ""spirit of Tanagra,"" his own mythic invention tied to the Tanagra figurines from the village of that name in ancient Greece. The sculpture was first shown at the Paris Salon of 1890. Gérôme subsequently created smaller, gilded bronze versions of Tanagra; several versions of the ""Hoop Dancer"" figurine held by Tanagra; two paintings of an imaginary ancient Tanagra workshop; and two self-portraits of himself sculpting Tanagra from a living model in his Paris atelier. These sculptures and paintings comprise a complex, self-referential artistic program in which one of the most celebrated artists of his generation[1] explored reception of Classical antiquity, creative inspiration, doppelgängers, and female beauty.

Tanagra is displayed at the Musée d'Orsay. Much of the polychromy has faded, and the hoop dancer is damaged (part of the hoop and right arm are missing.)

In December 1870, at a site called Tanagra in Greece, archaeologists unearthed a group of Hellenistic terra cotta figurines bearing traces of original polychrome. The discovery caused a sensation, because it provided firm evidence supporting the theory that ancient sculpture was painted. The Tanagra figurines, which depicted not gods or heroes but ordinary people, were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, where they charmed and fascinated the public. In subsequent decades, countless forgeries flooded the art market. Tanagra figurines infiltrated popular literature and theater, as seen by references in Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) and An Ideal Husband (1895), and Marcel Proust's Swann's Way (1913).[2]

As a painter and sculptor, Gérôme had long drawn inspiration from the Classical world. His famous images of gladiator combats, chariot races, slave markets, the assassination of Julius Caesar, and other subjects from ancient Greece and Rome were widely influential.

In his mid-sixties, Gérôme expressed his fascination with the Tanagra figurines, and the ancients who made and owned them, with his 5-foot-high, tinted-marble Tanagra, a female nude personifying the Tyche, or presiding spirit, of the ancient city. Tanagra sits stiffly upright ""atop an excavation mound. Numerous figurines have surfaced in the soil. At her feet lie the tools that allude to both the archaeological dig as well as Gérôme's role as sculptor.""[2] On the upraised palm of Tanagra’s hand is a figurine of a female Hoop Dancer (Gérôme's own invention, inspired by, but not a copy of, an actual Tanagra figurine). Thus Tanagra depicts a statue holding a statue. The larger statue sits rigidly posed while the smaller is a ""twirling figure, who gracefully dips her head into a golden ring clutched in her right hand and cups a golden ball in the other, as her drapery swirls around her.""[3]

""Inspired by his characteristic desire for both archaeological accuracy and realism, Gérôme delicately tinted the skin, hair, lips, and nipples of his Tanagra, causing a sensation at the Salon of 1890.""[4] A contemporary critic suggested that if the sculpture had been ""secretly buried for a time, and then publicly excavated as an antique, perhaps with a broken arm, it would have turned the heads of the whole art world, and been declared in its vital characteristics and subtle anatomy a rival to the Milo Venus.""[5]

Atelier de Tanagra (Tanagra workshop), 1893, private collection; auctioned by Sotheby's in 2013 for $125,000.

Gerome would subsequently create and sell numerous copies of the Hoop Dancer figurine held by his Tanagra, making the Hoop Dancer the modern-day equivalent of a Tanagra figurine. ""Here the artist is not so much breathing life into painted or sculpted flesh as reinventing for the modern age the mass-produced figurines of antiquity.""[3]

In 1893, Gérôme created two paintings of imaginary Tanagra workshops. Although Gérôme opposed the admission of female art students to the École des Beaux-Arts,[6] both of these paintings depict a female artist who is painting copies of Gérôme's Hoop Dancer figurine (a modern anachronism retrojected back in time). These Hoop Dancers are offered for sale, along with other figurines, to browsing art-lovers (all female) who themselves resemble Tanagra figurines. In one of these paintings a smaller version of Gérôme's Tanagra presides over the sales counter, holding a Hoop Dancer in her hand. This Tanagra is a painting of a statue holding a statue. Also in this painting, the young artisan is busy ""colouring an edition of 12 Hoop Dancers in various brilliant hues—a tongue-in-cheek advertisement, perhaps, made to promote the figurines that he [Gérôme] was offering for sale in two different sizes and a variety of media through his dealer and father-in-law Adolphe Goupil. The Hoop Dancer would be Gérôme’s most popular and widely reproduced sculpture.""[3]

Pygmalion and Galatea, c. 1890, in a private collection, seen in the background of Working in Marble.

In 1894 and 1890, Gérôme painted two versions of a self-portrait depicting the artist at work in his atelier: The Artist and His Model (now at the Haggin Museum) and Working in Marble (Dahesh Museum of Art). The self-portraits are very similar, but differ in at least one significant respect.

In these self-portraits Gérôme is seen sculpting Tanagra from a live model who holds the seated, stiffly upright pose, though her upturned palm is empty. Behind the model on its own stand is a large polychrome Hoop Dancer statuette of the sort Gérôme made for sale to the public. Various props litter the studio. In each painting, hanging on the wall in the background, is a painting by Gérôme of Pygmalion and Galatea, another of his works inspired by the ancient world (and made the same year as Tanagra).[7] The self-portraits depict a real sculptor (Gérôme) bringing life to a statue by copying a living woman; the Pygmalion paintings depict a mythical sculptor whose statue is becoming a living woman.

Left: Detail showing Pygmalion and Galatea in the background of The Artist and His Model. Right: detail showing a different Pygmalion and Galatea in the background of Working in Marble.

The doppelgängers and visual puns are complex, because the Pygmalion paintings in the two backgrounds are similar but not identical. Just as Gérôme painted two self-portraits, he also painted more than one version of Pygmalion and Galatea. The most famous, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows the kissing sculptor and statue from behind; it appears in the background of The Artist and His Model. But Gérôme painted at least one variant (now in a private collection), in which Pygmalion and Galatea are seen kissing from the front.[8] This version appears in Working in Marble.

In both self-portraits, a variant of Pygmalion and Galatea is depicted as a painting of a mythical sculptor and living statue within a painting of a real sculptor, a living model, and (despite appearances) a plaster (not marble) statue.
Like most 19th-century sculptors, Gérôme did not carve the marble himself but furnished professional marble cutters with a full-size plaster to use as a guide. It is this intermediate step that is depicted in Working in Marble, a title that refers to the overall creative process. Gérôme portrays himself on a turn stand putting the finishing touches on the plaster version of Tanagra, carefully judging the accuracy of his work against the live model.[4]
This complex self-portrait is ""a summation of Gérôme’s remarkable career as both painter and sculptor.""[4] As in all his works connected to Tanagra, we see Gérôme ""powerfully evoking the continuous interplay between painting and sculpture, reality and artifice, as well as highlighting the inherently theatrical nature of the artist’s studio.""[4]

The Haggin Museum also has a bronze Hoop Dancer by Gérôme, displayed beside The Artist and His Model.

The original Tanagra resides at the Musée d'Orsay (fiche oeuvre 15298). A 29.5-inch-high, gilded bronze version of Tanagra by Gérôme is held by the Phoenix Art Museum (object 1986.54), which also has a gilded bronze Hoop Dancer (object 2000.12). More gilded bronze versions of Tanagra exist; one was auctioned in 2011 by Sotheby's for 150,000 GBP,[9] another in 2017 by  for $50,000.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1516449,"The Madonna of Chancellor Rolin is an oil painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, dating from around 1435.  It is kept in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and was commissioned by Nicolas Rolin, aged 60,[1] chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, whose votive portrait takes up the left side of the picture, for his parish church, Notre-Dame-du-Chastel in Autun, where it remained until the church burnt down in 1793. After a period in Autun Cathedral, it was moved to the Louvre in 1805.

The scene depicts the Virgin Mary crowned by a hovering Angel while she presents the infant Jesus to Rolin. It is set within a spacious loggia with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river, probably intended to be Autun in Burgundy, Rolin's hometown. A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista.[2]  A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance.  As in many Early Netherlandish paintings, the steepness of the hills and mountains is shown as much greater than that found locally, for dramatic effect.

The small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues.  Beyond, two male figures wearing chaperons are looking through the crenellations of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge.  There has been speculation that they may represent van Eyck and an assistant, after the pattern of his Arnolfini Portrait.  The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the National Gallery, London.  Near to them are two magpies and two peacocks, the latter are symbols both of immorality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb.[3] However Martí Domínguez states- Peacocks were the symbol of Jesus Christ and magpies were regarded as evil. Artists like to oppose the symbolic birds, the dichotomy between good and evil: Van Eyck, in the panel of the Chancellor Rolin, will also use the peacock and the magpie.[4]

The interior has complex light sources, typical of van Eyck, with light coming both from the central portico and the side windows. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples.

As in other van Eycks, the depiction of the space is not as straightforward as it first appears.  Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way.[5]  Many van Eycks show an interior space that is actually very small, but the depiction is subtly managed to retain a sense of intimacy, but without feeling constricted.

Infrared reflectograms have disclosed a number of changes from the underdrawing.  Rolin had a large purse hanging from his belt; since he had grown very rich in public office he probably felt that would be inappropriate.  The infant Christ was originally pointing at the floor.  Old descriptions from Autun tell us that the painting originally had a wooden frame painted illusionistically with inscriptions seemingly carved, like van Eyck's two portraits in London (Léal Souvenir and Portrait of a Man in a Turban).

The Virgin sits with the infant Christ ""on her knee"" (i.e. on her thighs), which make a platform for the infant.  This very traditional motif is known as the Throne of Wisdom, and was often used by Jan van Eyck, who elaborated the meaning in complex allusions.  The Virgin's body was often compared to an altar, on which Christ was present as he was believed to be during the Mass.  This painting may have originally hung to the left of Rolin's place at the front of his chapel in his parish church, between him and the altar.  To Rolin, or a viewer of the real and painted Rolins together, the Virgin is painted in the position of the altar in the chapel.[6] The illuminated manuscript in front of Rolin is open to a page with a large initial D, which probably indicates ""Domine, labia mea aperies"" (""Lord, open my lips""), the opening of Matins; this is therefore a Book of Hours.

The architecture of the loggia, as in so many of van Eyck's paintings, is in a rich and delicate Romanesque style far from the Gothic styles of his own day.  The setting probably represents at the same time an imaginary building in Autun, and the ""Heavenly city of Jerusalem""; two personages from two worlds are shown, and their surrounding combines the world of each.

The painting might be connected with the appointment in 1436 of Rolin's son Jean as Bishop of Autun; there is a magnificent cathedral on the Virgin's side of the river.  Also, just above Rolin's hands there is a smaller church, perhaps intended to represent a new church dedicated to the Virgin, or his own parish church, Notre-Dame-du-Chastel which he greatly enriched.[7]

There appears to be a series of illustrations of the Seven deadly sins distributed among the details of the painting. The reliefs just over Rolin's head show (from left) the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise (Pride), the Killing of Abel by Cain (Envy) and the Drunkenness of Noah (Gluttony).  Then the lion-heads on the capitals behind Rolin may stand for Anger, and the tiny squashed rabbits between column and base in the loggia screen for Lust (which they were considered to exemplify in the Middle Ages).  All these details are on Rolin's side of the painting; no equivalents are visible on the other, divine, side.  However this leaves Avarice and Sloth unaccounted for, unless perhaps the human figures of Rolin himself (with his underdrawn purse), and the idlers out on the terrace (perhaps including, as stated above, van Eyck himself) represent the last two vices.[8]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2427320,"The Madonna of Loreto is an oil on panel painting by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael, executed c. 1511.[1] It is housed in the Musée Condé of Chantilly, France.[2][3]

For centuries the painting kept company with Raphael's Portrait of Pope Julius II, first at the Santa Maria del Popolo, then in private collections, and for a time their location was unknown.  Their ownership, or provenance, has been difficult to unravel because of the number of copies of both paintings, the unclear ownership chain, misinformation and delay of publication of vital information.

For instance, this painting received its name from a copy at the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto which was at one time thought to be the original.  Now is it certain that the painting at Loreto was a copy – and therefore the painting name is a misnomer.

Even so, the well-copied painting has been a beloved and critically acclaimed painting for centuries.

The painting is tender and intimate.  The Child, just awakened, plays a game with the Madonna's veil,[4] with a melancholy[5] Saint Joseph looking on from the shadows.[4]

The use of veil in Renaissance paintings, from the Meditations on the Life of Christ, symbolizes the manner in which the Madonna wrapped the Child in the veil from her head at the Nativity and, prophetically, again at the Crucifixion.[6]

Saint Joseph's melancholy nature in this picture may signal his proclivity for prophecy and the coming events for the Child.[5]  Saint Joseph seemed to be an after-thought, x-rays of the painting show that Saint Joseph was painted over[7][8] a window previously over the Madonna's shoulder.  Further, the change in the position of the Child's right foot was revealed via x-ray.  These changes align with Raphael's preliminary drawings for the painting.[9]

The Madonna's dress, frame and angle of her head are reminiscent of Justice in the Stanza della Segnatura[10][11] which was painted about the same time as this painting.[8] It is also reminiscent of the Madonna of the Blue Diadem.[8]

The history of the painting is difficult to track for many reasons, one of them being the various names for the painting, which tell the history, or the perceived history, of the original Raphael painting.  This work is one of the most copied works of Raphael with over one hundred known copies. 

The provenance of this painting is constructed based on documents, analysis of the painting and preliminary sketches. For centuries the painting was co-located with the Portrait of Pope Julius II, first at the Santa Maria del Popolo, then in private collections, and for a time their location was unknown. The original painting by Raphael is now believed to be the version at Musée Condé in Chantilly, France.

Julius II commissioned of Raphael[12] the Madonna of the Veil and his likeness, the Portrait of Pope Julius II which resided at Santa Maria del Popolo,[7][13][14]  at the entrance gate to Rome.[4] During this time the painting was also known as Madonna del Popolo or described as The Holy Family.[10]

An array of Renaissance artists were brought in to decorate the Santa Maria del Popolo church and its chapels in Rome, beginning with Raphael.[15]  Both paintings by Raphael, Julius II and the Madonna were hung on pillars during feast days[2][11] or high holy days.[13]

The two paintings, nearly the same size, seem as if they were meant to complement each other. Nearly the same size, they also both had a strong vertical orientation.  The eyes of the paintings were downcast and gave a contemplative feeling. The positioning and lighting within the paintings seems to indicate that they were meant to each flank a side of an altar in the domed chapel.  Although the paintings were paired for a time through change of ownership, Julius II is now located in the National Gallery.[2]

As a means of indicating Julius' appreciation of the Madonna, which resulted in the pairing of paintings, Julius commissioned another Madonna painting, the Sistine Madonna, in the last year of his life where his adoration is shown by the Pope kneeling at the feet of the Virgin.[16]

There are many suppositions about the circumstances surrounding the Madonna painting after Popolo, partly because there were many copies of the painting and partly due to delays in publication of vital documents.[9]

In 1591, Raphael's  Portrait of Julius II and what was later called Madonna of Loreto were removed from the church by Paolo Camillo Sfondrati, later Cardinal Sfondrati, and nephew of Pope Gregory XIV.[9][10][17] In 1608, he sold the paintings to Cardinal Scipione Borghese.[9]

The paintings, purchased in 1608 [9] were still recorded as part of the Borghese collection in 1693.[17]

The painting now residing in Chantilly, France, thought lost since the time of the French Revolution (1789–1799),[11] is believed to be the original.[7][9]

In October 1979, the Musée Condé held an exhibit titled La Madona de Lorette to present and document the newly cleaned and version of the painting, which was found to be the original Raphael painting. The exhibit was held at the request of the Institut de France, administrator of Musée Condé, and organized by the Louvre museum.[9]

Until 1979, the painting at Musée Condé had been attributed to Gianfrancesco Penni.[9]

The painting was determined to be the original Raphael Madonna painting for several reasons. First, the quality of the painting is extremely high, depicting an ""admirable equilibrium of motives and a subtle mixture of force and grace"" of ""the best works of Raphael"".   Second, the painting revealed through X-ray screening that Saint Joseph was painted after the Virgin and child were completed, based upon preparatory design or sketches, the changed could have only have been performed by Raphael and thus rules it out as a copy.[7][9]

A copy[9] was bequeathed by Girolamo Lottorio of Rome to the sanctuary of Loreto.  Further, in 1759 the painting disappeared and was replaced by copies of poor quality.[10]  With that in mind, the painting's name might be more appropriately named after its original home in Popolo or its resting place in Chantilly.[9]

Michaeli Grecchi Lucchese, a 16th-century engraver, produced a print of the Madonna di Loreto in 1553.[18]

At the Salon of 1814, Joseph Théodore Ricomme (born 1785), a noted engraver of great paintings such as Raphael's Madonnas, received a medal for an unprecedented showing of prints, notably for the supreme quality modern engraving of Raphael's Madonna of Loreto and Adam and Eve.[19]

Abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe's Palmetto Leaves (1873), a memoir and travel guide of Florida in the days following the end of the American Civil War, recounts comments from a woman named Minnah upon seeing the lithograph of Madonna of the Veil by Raphael:

O good Lord! If there ain't da Good Man when he was a baby. How harmless he lies there! so innocent! And here we be, we wicked sinners, turning our backs on him, and going to the Old Boy.  Oh Lord, Oh Lord! we ought to be better than we be: we sartin ought.[20][21]"
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3769183,"Judith and Her Maidservant or Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes is a circa 1510–1514 oil on panel painting by Correggio, now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 252.[2]

Details such as Judith's hairstyle date the work to Correggio's early period. Its subject matter was often painted by Correggio's master Mantegna, whilst its chiaroscuro effect laid the foundations for the noted ""nocturnes"" by Caravaggio.[3]

Its first definite appearance in the historical record dates to 1892, when Wilhelm von Bode bought it for its present owner. It was soon attributed to Correggio. There is a reference to a ""half-length"" Judith ""in mock-night"" in a Gonzaga inventory of 1627 which may be identifiable with the work, as may a number of mentions of a Correggio ""Herodias"", possibly a mistake for Judith in the c.1510 work.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1368055,"The Gleaners (Des glaneuses) is an oil painting by Jean-François Millet completed in 1857.

It depicts three peasant women gleaning a field of stray stalks of wheat after the harvest. The painting is famous for featuring in a sympathetic way what were then the lowest ranks of rural society; it was received poorly by the French upper classes.

Millet's The Gleaners was preceded by a vertical painting of the image in 1854 and an etching in 1855. Millet unveiled The Gleaners at the Salon in 1857. It immediately drew negative criticism from the middle and upper classes, who viewed the topic with suspicion: one art critic, speaking for other Parisians, perceived in it an alarming intimation of ""the scaffolds of 1793.""[1]

Having recently come out of the French Revolution of 1848, these prosperous classes saw the painting as glorifying the lower-class worker.[1] To them, it was a reminder that French society was built upon the labor of the working masses, and landowners linked this working class with the growing movement of socialism.[2] The depiction of the working class in The Gleaners made the upper classes feel uneasy about their status. The masses of workers greatly outnumbered the members of the upper class. This disparity in numbers meant that if the lower class were to revolt, the upper class would be overturned. With the French Revolution still fresh in the minds of the upper classes, this painting was not perceived well.

Millet's The Gleaners was also not perceived well due to its large size, 33 inches by 44 inches, or 84 by 112 centimetres. This was large for a painting depicting labor. Normally this size of a canvas was reserved for religious or mythological style paintings. Millet's work did not depict anything religiously affiliated, nor was there any reference to any mythological beliefs. The painting illustrated a realistic view of poverty and the working class. One critic commented that ""his three gleaners have gigantic pretensions, they pose as the Three Fates of Poverty...their ugliness and their grossness unrelieved.""[3]

While the act of gleaning was not a new topic—representations of Ruth had existed in art—this new work was a statement on rural poverty and not biblical piety:[3] there is no touch of the biblical sense of community and compassion in the contrasting embodiments of grinding poverty in the foreground and the rich harvest in the sunlit distance beyond. The implicit irony was unsettling.[4]

After the Salon, Millet, short on money, sold his piece for 3,000 francs—below his asking price of 4,000[4]—after haggling with an Englishman named Binder who would not budge for his meagre counter-offer; Millet tried to keep the miserable price a secret.[5]

While The Gleaners garnered little but notoriety during his life, after his death in 1875, public appreciation of his work steadily broadened. In 1889, the painting, then owned by banker Ferdinand Bischoffsheim, sold for 300,000 francs at auction.[4] The buyer remained anonymous, but rumours were that the painting was coveted by an American buyer. It was announced less than a week later that Champagne maker Jeanne-Alexandrine Louise Pommery had acquired the piece, which silenced gossip on her supposed financial issues after leaving her grapes on the vines weeks longer than her competitors.


At Madame Pommery's death in 1891, and following the conditions of her will, the painting was donated to the Louvre.[4] It now resides in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.
What does The Gleaners show? [The women] embody an animal force deeply absorbed by a painstaking task. The contrast between wealth and poverty, power and helplessness, male and female spheres is forcefully rendered.

— Liana Vardi[6]

The Gleaners is one of Millet's best-known works. Its imagery of bending peasant women gleaning was paraphrased frequently in works by younger artists such as Pissarro, Renoir, Seurat, and van Gogh.[7] Art historian Robert Rosenblum says Millet's painting introduced ""imposing new presences in the repertory of mid-century art, with endless progeny in city and country. Daumier's and Degas's laundresses, and even more so Caillebotte's floor-scrapers, are almost unthinkable without Millet's epic hymn to labor.""[8]

The Gleaners provides evidence of Millet's role as a contemporary social critic. His brutal depiction of three hunched, female paupers segregated from the laborers and the abundant crop in the distance demonstrates his attention to, if not necessarily sympathy for, the plight of the poorest members of the community around Barbizon and its larger neighbor, Chailly, as the area experienced the growing pains of French modernization. Only about thirty-five miles from the French capital (whose population doubled between 1831 and 1851), the rich, broad plain bordering the forest of Fontainebleau was among the earliest with a rail link to Paris, readily lending itself to feeding the burgeoning city.

Studies tracing the transformation of rural France in the nineteenth century note that little change in peasant life occurred beyond northern France and the Paris basin until the last quarter of the century. Millet's representation of class strife on a large-scale farm was thus uniquely modern in the 1850s.[4]

The painting inspired and is discussed in the 2000 film by Agnès Varda, The Gleaners and I. The film itself inspired a 2019 studio album by American jazz bassist Larry Grenadier. The Gleaners was included in the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a piece of art that can be donated to the museum.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20087524,"The Spanish Dancers (French: Danseuses Espagnoles) was a piece created in 1921 by Cubist artist Marie Laurencin. While in Spain she was homesick, unhappy and did very little work. She had also recently ended her long-term relationship with Cubist art critique Guillaume Apollinaire (1907–1912) and married German artist Baron Otto von Waëtjen. Thus freeing Laurencin of Cubist influence, but isolating herself in the process. By marrying a foreign German she had forfeited her French citizenship making her feel alone and exiled from her own country. Despite her exiled sentiments while in Spain, upon returning to Paris in 1921 she felt some nostalgia for her adopted Spanish culture. After only a year of marriage, Waëtjen and Laurencin divorced and she returned to Paris where she created The Spanish Dancers.[1]

The Spanish Dancers features three women in the foreground of the painting. The woman standing to the far left is wearing a light blue dress. While the woman in the center is kneeling wearing a pink ballerina dress, as the woman to the far right is hunched down and is wearing a light grey dress with a light blue headscarf. The background of the composition is a dark grey and contrasts the light colors of the three women's skin and clothing. And upon closer inspection, you can see there is the head of a horse and a dog overlapping within the image.

Laurencin also adopts a completely new and mature style after she returns from Spain. No longer was she painting in strictly soft and feminine tones with delicate and soft pastel palettes. Instead she developed a darker style incorporating greys, blues and pinks. However, her female subjects remains the same. But there is something more expressive and dynamic about The Spanish Dancers compared to the rest of her work. The faces of the women have more shadow and depth. While the background is dark and sharply contrasts her earlier work of delicate interior scenes. The angularity of the figures and their dynamic body poses move the eye through the composition and create a sense of dimension that is often lacking in many of her other works.[2]

There is an influence from Cubism that did not exist before her time in Spain. The lines of her figures and the angles that outline the composition are all classic Cubist troupes. The new contrasting color scheme is also a technique found in Cubism and is reminiscent of Picasso’s blue period.[3] Also, the noticeable use of shading and shadow in the background and on the figures faces  is also a technique influenced by Cubism. The work is also a “Parisian” depiction of Spanish dancers. The women are very aristocratic with ambiguous expressions that are difficult to interpret. These characters are a part of the feminine and decorative images Laurencin creates but in a new and elevated style. Yet, this unique style Laurencin developed after her time in Spain is short-lived. And is promptly followed by a stylistic shift that incorporates the more refined style of The Spanish Dancers and her usual feminine portraits.

She went on to marry Renoir's second son Jean in 1920 and become a film actress.

Renoir was struck by her flawless young skin and rendered her in soft tones dominated by the colour red. The flower in her hair had by this time became a trademark symbol of Renoir to symbolise beauty.

The painting passed on the artist's death in 1919 to his youngest son Claude, who sold it to art dealer Paul Guillaume in 1929.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1114718,"Dance in the Country (French: Danse à la campagne) is an 1883 oil painting by French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. It is currently kept at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[1]

This painting was commissioned in 1882 by the merchant Paul Durand-Ruel who wanted works on the theme of the ball. He bought it in 1886, exhibited it for the first time in April 1883, and kept it until Renoir's death in 1919. Two complementary painting on the same theme, named Dance in the City and Dance at Bougival, were also painted by Renoir the same year.[1][2]

The painting, influenced by the artist's trip in Italy in 1881 where he found inspiration from Raphael, marked an evolution of the painter who tried then to break away from Impressionism.[2]

The painting depicts a couple dancing under a chestnut tree: the man is Paul Lhôte, a friend of the painter, and the woman is Aline Charigot, who later became the wife of the painter. Both figures are painted life-size and occupy almost the entire painting. However, a table in the background on the right, and a hat on the ground,  and a pair of faces below the level of the dance floor, can be seen. The woman who holds a fan in her right hand, displays a smiling face and looks towards the viewer. The scene is bathed in a bright and cheerful atmosphere, and the women's clothes use warm colors (yellow gloves, red hat).[3]

The paintings two companion pieces, Dance in the City and Dance at Bougival, also show a couple dancing.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q563727,"

The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne is an unfinished oil painting by High Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to c. 1501–1519.[n 1] It depicts Saint Anne, her daughter the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus.[1] Christ is shown grappling with a sacrificial lamb symbolizing his Passion as the Virgin tries to restrain him. The painting was commissioned as the high altarpiece for the Church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence and its theme had long preoccupied Leonardo.[citation needed]

It is likely that the painting was commissioned by King Louis XII of France following the birth of his daughter in 1499, but it was never delivered to him.[1] Leonardo probed into incorporating these figures together by drawing the Burlington House Cartoon (National Gallery).[1] In 2008, a curator at the Louvre discovered several faint sketches believed to have been made by Leonardo on the back of the painting.[2][3][4] Infrared reflectography was used to reveal a ""7-by-4 inch drawing of a horse's head"", which had a resemblance to sketches of horses that Leonardo had made previously before drawing The Battle of Anghiari. Also revealed was a second sketch 61⁄2 inch-by-4  inch depiction of half a skull. A third sketch showed the infant Jesus playing with a lamb, which sketch was similar to that which is painted on the front side.[2] The Louvre spokesperson said that the sketches were ""very probably"" made by Leonardo and that it was the first time that any drawing had been found on the ""flip side of one of his works"". The drawings will be further studied by a group of experts as the painting undergoes restoration.[2]

Leonardo's painting is at once both pleasing, calm yet confusing upon closer examination. The composition of the three figures is fairly tight, with the Virgin Mary clearly interacting with the infant Jesus. Upon closer examination of their positioning it is apparent that Mary is sitting on Saint Anne's lap. It is unclear what meaning this could have and what meaning Leonardo intended to project with that pose. There is no clear parallel in other works of art and women sitting in each other's lap are not a clear cultural or traditional reference that the viewer can relate to. Additionally, although the exact sizes of neither the Mother Virgin nor Saint Anne are known, it can be extrapolated from the painting that Saint Anne is a significantly larger person than Mary. This subtle yet perceptible distortion in size was utilized by Leonardo to emphasize the mother–daughter relationship between the two women despite the apparent lack of visual cues to the greater age of Saint Anne that would otherwise identify her as the mother. The child is holding a lamb. We also see that Mary is gazing into her child's eyes, while Saint Anne is looking at Mary. As Mary is sitting on her lap and Saint Anne is looking at her, it is possible that Leonardo was trying to make a point about their relationship and personalities.

Sigmund Freud undertook a psychoanalytic examination of Leonardo in his 1910 essay Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood. According to Freud, the Virgin's garment reveals a vulture when viewed sideways.  Freud claimed that this was a manifestation of a ""passive homosexual"" childhood fantasy that Leonardo wrote about in the Codex Atlanticus, in which he recounts being attacked as an infant in his crib by the tail of a vulture. Freud translated the passage thus:""It seems that I was always destined to be so deeply concerned with vultures – for I recall as one of my very earliest memories that while I was in my cradle a vulture came down to me, and opened my mouth with its tail, and struck me many times with its tail against my lips.""

Unfortunately for Freud, the word 'vulture' was a mistranslation by the German translator of the Codex and the bird that Leonardo imagined was in fact a kite, a bird of prey which is also occasionally a scavenger. This disappointed Freud because, as he confessed to Lou Andreas-Salomé, he regarded Leonardo as ""the only beautiful thing I have ever written"". Some Freudian scholars have, however, made attempts to repair the theory by incorporating the kite.

Another theory proposed by Freud attempts to explain Leonardo's fondness of depicting the Virgin Mary with Saint Anne. Leonardo was raised by his blood mother initially before being ""adopted"" by the wife of his father Ser Piero. The idea of depicting the Mother of God with her own mother was therefore particularly close to Leonardo's heart, because he, in a sense, had ""two mothers"" himself. It is worth noting that in both versions of the composition (the Louvre painting and the London cartoon) it is hard to discern whether Saint Anne is a full generation older than Mary.

On 7 October 2011 Le Journal des arts [fr], a Paris art publication, reported that the restoration posed more danger to the painting than was previously expected.[5] In late December 2011 and early January 2012 reports emerged that Ségolène Bergeon Langle, the former director of conservation for the Louvre and France's national museums, and Jean-Pierre Cuzin, the former director of paintings at the Louvre, both of the advisory committee supervising the painting's restoration, had resigned[6] over a painting cleaning controversy, with critics claiming that the painting has been damaged by being cleaned so it became brighter than the artist ever intended.[7]
Other experts spoke out in favour of the cleaning treatment.[8]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3918344,"The Toilette of Esther or Esther Preparing to be Presented to King Ahasuerus, is an 1841 oil-on-canvas painting by Théodore Chassériau. The painting depicts a moment from the scriptural Book of Esther, when Esther prepared to meet King Ahasuerus, ruler of Persia, who subsequently took her as his wife. The painting is in the Musée du Louvre. Vincent Pomarède of the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon has described it as ""one of the most famous (paintings) in the Louvre"".[1]

The subject derives from the Book of Esther (2:8-9, 15), in which King Ahasuerus, having renounced his wife Vashti, seeks a new queen. Esther, a woman of great beauty, finds favor with Hegai, the eunuch responsible for preparing women for presentation to the king. Upon seeing Esther, Ahasuerus chooses her as his wife. She later reveals that she is Jewish, and intercedes with the king in order to spare the lives of the empire's Jews.

While choosing a biblical theme as a subject, it is likely that Chassériau drew upon more recent literary sources for inspiration. The play Esther, produced by Jean Racine in 1689, offers a more chaste version of Esther's seduction, while describing the artifice employed by her rivals for the king's attention.[2] The exoticism of the painting is closer to an 1817 poem by Alfred de Vigny entitled Le Bain d'une dame romaine, which includes the description:

and is reminiscent also of Les Orientales by Victor Hugo:

The episode had rarely been painted before. Only two previous versions are known: a 17th-century painting by Aert de Gelder, and an 18th-century work by Jean-Francois de Troy.[1] Given the dearth of pictorial illustrations of the story, Chassériau would have looked to paintings of women at their toilette, including depictions of Venus, of which there were more numerous examples.[1]

Esther is shown seated at the center of the canvas, arms above her head as she arranges her blond coiffure. Preparing to offer herself for the king's approval, she holds a pose that is ""profoundly erotic in its pictorial treatment"".[1] She is nude to the waist except for a necklace and bracelets on her arms; her legs are swathed in white- and rose-colored garments. At the left a servant woman dressed in rich blue brings accessories, and at the right Hegai, clad in bright red, offers a jewel box. Esther acknowledges neither of them, staring out of the picture to the left. Behind them is a landscape of trees and sky. 

Several preparatory studies exist. Two drawings in the Louvre evidence an initially circular composition, a tondo like The Turkish Bath that Chassériau's teacher Ingres would paint in 1862.[1] Such experiments underscore Chassériau's desire to find original motifs, as he wrote alongside a drawing at the time: ""....Put...the history...of the world in a new way...allowing one to see these beautiful things once again by presenting them in a fresh manner. May 1841. For my painting Esther preparing her toilette"".[1] The lush accessories and overall coloring owe something to Chassériau's admiration for Eugène Delacroix.[3]

Art historians have long noted Chassériau's affection for his sisters, and their subconscious influence on the female figures in his art.[4] Perhaps drawing on the recollection of Chassériau's mistress Clémence Monnerot, who said ""Adèle has superb arms; they appear everywhere"", Jean-Louis Vaudoyer believed that the beauty of the artist's older sister could be found in Esther's ""muscular, almost masculine, arms"".[4]

The choice of an Old Testament story about a young woman in a harem freed Chassériau to take advantage of Orientalist and Romantic elements. The presence of Asian figures and sumptuous jewelry serves to further eroticize Esther's figure.[1] Having previously painted a Birth of Venus and a Susanna and the Elders, Chassériau found another theme which permitted a frankly sexual presentation of the female body.[5]

The painting was not fully understood when first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1842. If the critics recognized an insipidness in Esther's expression—one journalist complained ""But why that elongated figure, those wild eyes, that savage look? There is no soul under that face...""—they failed to properly appreciate the originality of a biblical story re-imagined in an erotic, Romantic fashion.[1] The painting would later inspire painters such as François-Léon Benouville and Gustave Moreau.[1]

The Toilette of Esther was bequeathed to the Louvre in 1934 by Baron Arthur Chassériau, a distant relative of the artist, as part of a donation that included most of the artist's work in his possession.[3]

Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh painted a self-portrait in oil on canvas in September 1889. The work, which may have been Van Gogh's last self-portrait, was painted shortly before he left Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in southern France.[1][2][3] The painting is now at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[4]

This self-portrait was one of about 32 produced over a 10-year period, and these were an important part of his work as a painter;[1][2] he painted himself because he often lacked the money to pay for models.[5] He took the painting with him to Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul Gachet, who thought it was ""absolutely fanatical"".[2][6]

Art historians are divided as to whether this painting or Self-portrait without beard is Van Gogh's final self-portrait. Art historians Ingo F. Walther and Jan Hulsker consider this to be the last, with Hulsker considering that it was painted in Arles following Van Gogh's admission to hospital after mutilating his ear, while Ronald Pickvance thinks Self-portrait without beard was the later painting.[2][7]

Van Gogh sent the picture to his younger brother, the art dealer Theo; an accompanying letter read: ""You will need to study [the picture] for a time. I hope you will notice that my facial expressions have become much calmer, although my eyes have the same insecure look as before, or so it appears to me.""[8]

Walther and Rainer Metzger consider that ""the picture is not a pretty pose nor a realistic record ... [it is] one that has seen too much jeopardy, too much turmoil, to be able to keep its agitation and trembling under control.""[9] According to Beckett the dissolving colours and same time turbulent patterns signal a feeling of strain and pressure, symbolising the artist's state of mind, which is under a mental, physical and emotional pressure.[10]

The Musée d'Orsay in Paris, who obtained the picture in 1986,[11] noted that ""the model's immobility contrasts with the undulating hair and beard, echoed and amplified in the hallucinatory arabesques of the background.""[1]

Another self-portrait from 1889, often called the Oslo self-portrait because it is owned by the Nasjonalmuseet in Norway,[12] was authenticated in 2020 by the Van Gogh Museum.[13] This painting, with the artist looking sideways, was painted while the artist was in the asylum in Saint-Rémy and is ""unmistakeably"" his work. Experts believe it was painted after Van Gogh's letter of 22 August 1889, which indicated that he was still ""disturbed"" but ready to begin painting again. It was completed prior to his letter of 20 September 1889, in which Van Gogh referred to the self-portrait as ""an attempt from when I was ill"".
[14]

The Museum's report stated that ""The Oslo self-portrait depicts someone who is mentally ill; his timid, sideways glance is easily recognisable and is often found in patients suffering from depression and psychosis"".[15]

The panels are now in different locations: the lunette and the central panel, depicting the Ascension of Christ, are in the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon, France.

The polyptych had been originally commissioned for the Abbey of San Pietro at Perugia, the contract having been signed by Perugino on 8 March 1495. It included a large altarpiece and several panels, within a wooden frame by  Domenico da Verona. The altarpiece, depicting the Ascension of Christ, was to have a lunette with the God in Glory between Angels above it, while the predella had not been exactly defined. The payment was 500  golden ducats, and no more than two years and a half were given to complete the work.

The panels were painted between January 1496 and the end of 1499, and the work was solemnly inaugurated on 13 January 1500. Contemporary art historian Giorgio Vasari considered the predella Perugino's best work in his home city.

In 1591 the church's choir was radically restored, and the altar had to be dismantled. After the religious suppressions of 1797, the work was acquired by the French, and was divided into several French museums, although several panels remained in Perugia or went to Papal collections in Rome.

The cymatium was separated by the main panel by a frame, in the same way of the Vallombrosa Altarpiece. At the sides were two columns which supported the frame arch and which, at the bases, were decorated by three small panels with Saints, sharing the same background.

The polyptych included the following panels:

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1857132,"Vue de toits (Effet de neige) (English title: View of rooftops (Effect of snow)) is an oil painting by French impressionist Gustave Caillebotte executed in the winter of 1878 and 1879.[1] The canvas measures 81 by 65 centimetres (32 in × 26 in). It was originally gifted by Caillebotte's brother in 1894 to the Musée du Luxembourg,[2] then transferred to the Musée du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, which held many impressionist works in France after World War II. In 1986, it was transferred again to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed.[2] The painting is one of the few Caillebotte works that have remained in public view since the artist's death in 1894.[3]

Caillebotte created many paintings showing urban Paris from unexpected perspectives, such as a streetscape seen from indoors in Jeune homme à la fenêtre (1875), or the exaggerated perspective of Rue de Paris, temps de pluie (1877). Vue de toits depicts snow-covered rooftops in Montmartre, Paris from a high vantage point, possibly a balcony. Here Caillebotte employs a largely monochromatic palette of grays, adding additional color to highlight building features.[3] This perspective was not at all common in French paintings, and in fact Caillebotte may have been inspired by the photographic works of Hippolyte Bayard.[4]

The painting was first shown at the fourth Impressionist Exhibition held in Paris in 1879, one of 25 works Caillebotte brought to the show. At the time, it did not garner much interest from the crowds, who preferred his portraits and nautical images. However, this image, and one other showing views of rooftops at that show, are now considered important works.[3]

Melencolia I is a large 1514 engraving by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer. The print's central subject is an enigmatic and gloomy winged female figure thought to be a personification of melancholia – melancholy. Holding her head in her hand, she stares past the busy scene in front of her. The area is strewn with symbols and tools associated with craft and carpentry, including an hourglass, weighing scales, a hand plane, a claw hammer, and a saw. Other objects relate to alchemy, geometry or numerology. Behind the figure is a structure with an embedded magic square, and a ladder leading beyond the frame. The sky contains a rainbow, a comet or planet, and a bat-like creature bearing the text that has become the print's title.

Dürer's engraving is one of the most well-known extant old master prints, but, despite a vast art-historical literature, it has resisted any definitive interpretation. Dürer may have associated melancholia with creative activity;[2] the woman may be a representation of a Muse, awaiting inspiration but fearful that it will not return.  As such, Dürer may have intended the print as a veiled self-portrait. Other art historians see the figure as pondering the nature of beauty or the value of artistic creativity in light of rationalism,[3] or as a purposely obscure work that highlights the limitations of allegorical or symbolic art.

The art historian Erwin Panofsky, whose writing on the print has received the most attention, detailed its possible relation to Renaissance humanists' conception of melancholia. Summarizing its art-historical legacy, he wrote that ""the influence of Dürer's Melencolia I—the first representation in which the concept of melancholy was transplanted from the plane of scientific and pseudo-scientific folklore to the level of art—extended all over the European continent and lasted for more than three centuries.""[4]

Melencolia I has been the subject of more scholarship than probably any other print. As the art historian Campbell Dodgson wrote in 1926, ""The literature on Melancholia is more extensive than that on any other engraving by Dürer: that statement would probably remain true if the last two words were omitted.""[5] Panofsky's studies in German and English, between 1923 and 1964 and sometimes with coauthors, have been especially influential.[6] Melencolia I is one of Dürer's three Meisterstiche (""master prints""), along with Knight, Death and the Devil (1513) and St. Jerome in His Study (1514).[7][8] The prints are considered thematically related by some art historians, depicting labours that are intellectual (Melencolia I), moral (Knight), or spiritual (St. Jerome) in nature.[9] While Dürer sometimes distributed Melencolia I with St. Jerome in His Study, there is no evidence that he conceived of them as a thematic group.[6] The print has two states; in the first, the number nine in the magic square appears backward,[10] but in the second, more common impressions it is a somewhat odd-looking regular nine.

There is little documentation to provide insight into Dürer's intent.[6] He made a few pencil studies for the engraving and some of his notes relate to it. A commonly quoted note refers to the keys and the purse—""Schlüssel—gewalt/pewtell—reichtum beteut"" (""keys mean power, purse means wealth"")[11]—although this can be read as a simple record of their traditional symbolism.[12] Another note reflects on the nature of beauty. In 1513 and 1514, Dürer experienced the death of a number of friends, followed by his mother (whose portrait he drew in this period), engendering a grief that may be expressed in this engraving.[6][13][14] Dürer mentions melancholy only once in his surviving writings. In an unfinished book for young artists, he cautions that too much exertion may lead one to ""fall under the hand of melancholy"".[15]

Panofsky considered but rejected the suggestion that the ""I"" in the title might indicate that Dürer had planned three other engravings on the four temperaments.[16]  He suggested instead that the ""I"" referred to the first of three types of melancholy defined by Cornelius Agrippa (see Interpretation). Others see the ""I"" as a reference to nigredo, the first stage of the alchemical process.[17]

The winged, central figure is thought to be a personification of melancholia or geometry.[19] She sits on a slab with a closed book on her lap, holds a compass loosely, and gazes intensely into the distance. Seemingly immobilized by gloom, she pays no attention to the many objects around her.[11] Reflecting the medieval iconographical depiction of melancholy, she rests her head on a closed fist.[9] Her face is relatively dark, indicating the accumulation of black bile, and she wears a wreath of watery plants (water parsley and watercress[20][21] or lovage). A set of keys and a purse hang from the belt of her long dress. Behind her, a windowless building with no clear architectural function[22][20] rises beyond the top of the frame. A ladder with seven rungs leans against the structure, but neither its beginning nor end is visible. A putto sits atop a millstone (or grindstone) with a chip in it. He scribbles on a tablet, or perhaps a burin used for engraving; he is generally the only active element of the picture.[23] Attached to the structure is a balance scale above the putto, and above Melancholy is a bell and an hourglass with a sundial at the top. Numerous unused tools and mathematical instruments are scattered around, including a hammer and nails, a saw, a plane, pincers, a straightedge, a molder's form, and either the nozzle of a bellows or an enema syringe (clyster). On the low wall behind the large polyhedron is a brazier with a goldsmith's crucible and a pair of tongs.[19] To the left of the emaciated, sleeping dog is a censer, or an inkwell with a strap connecting a pen holder.[24]

A bat-like creature spreads its wings across the sky, revealing a banner printed with the words ""Melencolia I"". Beyond it is a rainbow and an object which is either Saturn or a comet. In the far distance is a landscape with small treed islands, suggesting flooding, and a sea. The rightmost portion of the background may show a large wave crashing over land. Panofsky believes that it is night, citing the ""cast-shadow"" of the hourglass on the building, with the moon lighting the scene and creating a lunar rainbow.[7]

The print contains numerous references to mathematics and geometry. In front of the dog lies a perfect sphere, which has a radius equal to the apparent distance marked by the figure's compass.[6] On the face of the building is a 4×4 magic square—the first printed in Europe[25]—with the two middle cells of the bottom row giving the date of the engraving, 1514, which is also seen above Dürer's monogram at bottom right. The square follows the traditional rules of magic squares: each of its rows, columns, and diagonals adds to the same number, 34. It is also associative, meaning that any number added to its symmetric opposite equals 17 (e.g., 15+2, 9+8). Additionally, the corners and each quadrant sum to 34, as do still more combinations.[26][27] Dürer's mother died on May 17, 1514;[28] some interpreters connect the digits of this date with the sets of two squares that sum to 5 and 17. The unusual solid that dominates the left half of the image is a truncated rhombohedron[29][30] with what may be a faint skull[6] or face, possibly even of Dürer.[31] This shape is now known as Dürer's solid, and over the years, there have been numerous analyses of its mathematical properties.[32]

In contrast with Saint Jerome in His Study, which has a strong sense of linear perspective and an obvious source of light, Melencolia I is disorderly and lacks a ""visual center"".[33] It has few perspective lines leading to the vanishing point (below the bat-like creature at the horizon), which divides the diameter of the rainbow in the golden ratio.[34] The work otherwise scarcely has any strong lines. The unusual polyhedron destabilizes the image by blocking some of the view into the distance and sending the eye in different directions.[31] There is little tonal contrast and, despite its stillness, a sense of chaos, a ""negation of order"",[20] is noted by many art historians. The mysterious light source at right, which illuminates the image, is unusually placed for Dürer and contributes to the ""airless, dreamlike space"".[33]

Dürer's friend and first biographer Joachim Camerarius wrote the earliest account of the engraving in 1541. Addressing its apparent symbolism, he said, ""to show that such [afflicted] minds commonly grasp everything and how they are frequently carried away into absurdities, [Dürer] reared up in front of her a ladder into the clouds, while the ascent by means of rungs is ... impeded by a square block of stone.""[35] Later, the 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari described Melencolia I as a technical achievement that ""puts the whole world in awe"".[36]

Most art historians view the print as an allegory, assuming that a unified theme can be found in the image if its constituent symbols are ""unlocked"" and brought into conceptual order. This sort of interpretation assumes that the print is a Vexierbild (a ""puzzle image"") or rebus whose ambiguities are resolvable.[37] Others see the ambiguity as intentional and unresolvable. Merback notes that ambiguities remain even after the interpretation of numerous individual symbols: the viewer does not know if it is daytime or twilight, where the figures are located, or the source of illumination.[22] The ladder leaning against the structure has no obvious beginning or end, and the structure overall has no obvious function. The bat may be flying from the scene, or is perhaps some sort of daemon related to the traditional conception of melancholia.

Certain relationships in humorism, astrology, and alchemy are important for understanding the interpretive history of the print. Since the ancient Greeks, the health and temperament of an individual were thought to be determined by the four humors: black bile (melancholic humor), yellow bile (choleric), phlegm (phlegmatic), and blood (sanguine). In astrology, each temperament was under the influence of a planet, Saturn in the case of melancholia. Each temperament was also associated with one of the four elements; melancholia was paired with Earth, and was considered ""dry and cold"" in alchemy. Melancholia was traditionally the least desirable of the four temperaments, making for a constitution that was, according to Panofsky, ""awkward, miserly, spiteful, greedy, malicious, cowardly, faithless, irreverent and drowsy"".[38]

In 1905, Heinrich Wölfflin called the print an ""allegory of deep, speculative thought"". A few years earlier, the Viennese art historian Karl Giehlow had published two articles that laid the groundwork for Panofsky's extensive study of the print. Giehlow specialized in the German humanist interest in hieroglyphics and interpreted Melencolia I in terms of astrology, which had been an interest of intellectuals connected to the court of Maximilian in Vienna. Giehlow found the print an ""erudite summa of these interests, a comprehensive portrayal of the melancholic temperament, its positive and negative values held in perfect balance, its potential for 'genius' suspended between divine inspiration and dark madness"".[39]

According to Panofsky, who wrote about the print three times between 1923 and 1964,[41] Melencolia I combines the traditional iconographies of melancholy and geometry, both governed by Saturn. Geometry was one of the Seven Liberal Arts and its mastery was considered vital to the creation of high art, which had been revolutionised by new understandings of perspective. In the engraving, symbols of geometry, measurement, and trades are numerous: the compass, the scale, the hammer and nails, the plane and saw, the sphere and the unusual polyhedron. Panofsky examined earlier personifications of geometry and found much similarity between Dürer's engraving and an allegory of geometry from Gregor Reisch's Margarita philosophica (1503), a popular encyclopedia.[40][42]

Other aspects of the print reflect the traditional symbolism of melancholy, such as the bat, emaciated dog, purse and keys. The figure wears a wreath of ""wet"" plants to counteract the dryness of melancholy, and she has the dark face and dishevelled appearance associated with the melancholic. The intensity of her gaze, however, suggests an intent to depart from traditional depictions of this temperament. The magic square is a talisman of Jupiter, an auspicious planet that fends off melancholy—different square sizes were associated with different planets, with the 4×4 square representing Jupiter.[43][44] Even the distant seascape, with small islands of flooded trees, relates to Saturn, the ""lord of the sea"", and his control of floods and tides.[45]

Panofsky believed that Dürer's understanding of melancholy was influenced by the writings of the German humanist Cornelius Agrippa, and before him Marsilio Ficino. Ficino thought that most intellectuals were influenced by Saturn and were thus melancholic. He equated melancholia with elevation of the intellect, since black bile ""raises thought to the comprehension of the highest, because it corresponds to the highest of the planets"".[46] Before the Renaissance, melancholics were portrayed as embodying the vice of acedia, meaning spiritual sloth.[11] Ficino and Agrippa's writing gave melancholia positive connotations, associating it with flights of genius. As art historian Philip Sohm summarizes, Ficino and Agrippa gave Renaissance intellectuals a ""Neoplatonic conception of melancholy as divine inspiration ... Under the influence of Saturn, ... the melancholic imagination could be led to remarkable achievements in the arts"".[6]

Agrippa defined three types of melancholic genius in his De occulta philosophia.[47] The first, melancholia imaginativa, affected artists, whose imaginative faculty was considered stronger than their reason (compared with, e.g., scientists) or intuitive mind (e.g., theologians). Dürer might have been referring to this first type of melancholia, the artist's, by the ""I"" in the title. Melancholia was thought to attract daemons that produced bouts of frenzy and ecstasy in the afflicted, lifting the mind toward genius.[6] In Panofsky's summary, the imaginative melancholic, the subject of Dürer's print, ""typifies the first, or least exalted, form of human ingenuity. She can invent and build, and she can think ... but she has no access to the metaphysical world ... [She] belongs in fact to those who 'cannot extend their thought beyond the limits of space.' Hers is the inertia of a being which renounces what it could reach because it cannot reach for what it longs.""[13] Dürer's personification of melancholia is of ""a being to whom her allotted realm seems intolerably restricted—of a being whose thoughts 'have reached the limit'"".[48] Melencolia I portrays a state of lost inspiration: the figure is ""surrounded by the instruments of creative work, but sadly brooding with a feeling that she is achieving nothing.""[49]

Autobiography runs through many of the interpretations of Melencolia I, including Panofsky's. Iván Fenyő considered the print a representation of an artist beset by a loss of confidence, saying: ""shortly before [Dürer] drew Melancholy, he wrote: 'what is beautiful I do not know' ... Melancholy is a lyric confession, the self-conscious introspection of the Renaissance artist, unprecedented in northern art. Erwin Panofsky is right in considering this admirable plate the spiritual self-portrait of Dürer.""[50]

Within the magic square of Melencolia § I, the combinations to be recognized are varied and surprising: «each corner group, formed by four squares (16, 3, 5, 10 - 2, 13, 11, 8 - 9, 6, 4, 15 – 7, 12, 14, 1), has the sum of 34. The same number is obtained by adding the digits of the central group (10, 11, 6, 7), but also those of the corner squares (16, 13, 4, 1). The same result is obtained by adding the digits on the horizontal, vertical, diagonal lines. We always get 34. In total, the number occurs sixteen times. Sixteen is the total number of enclosed squares. This is a property that also appears in Henricus Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim's Tabula Jovis, but which has gone unnoticed by many, perhaps because it does not appear in the list of its characteristics, drawn up by the author himself.[51] The characteristic of the sums of each zone is also shared in the analogous schemes of Mescupolo and Paracelsus.[52] Despite the similarity with these, the magic square of Melencolia § I does not seem chosen to follow a hermetic tradition. The unspoken exclusivity of this type of square may be the reason for the dedication to Jupiter (privileged among the gods and the greatest of the planets) and for Dürer's choice. In truth, its most reliable source is found in the description that Luca Pacioli proposes as a pleasant curiosity [«ligiadro solazo» (f. 122r)], attributing its origin to the greatest astronomers, ""Ptolomeo al humasar ali, al fragano, Geber and to all the others "". These ""have dedicated to Jupiter [planet «Giove»][53]  the figure made up of 4 squares on each side, with the numbers arranged in such a way as to obtain 34 for each direction, that is 16, 3, 2, 13 and in the following line 5, 10, 11, 8, therefore in the third line 9 [etc.] as seen in the margin.""[54]» [55] Since this indicated scheme does not appear in the manuscript, it has been completed with blue digits (see image). The magic square of Melencolia § I represents a jovial exercise (lat. iovialis, from Iovis) to counter the influences of melancholy. In the lower center, the union of the numbers 15 and 14 indicates a very sad year.[56]

In 1991, Peter-Klaus Schuster published Melencolia I: Dürers Denkbild,[57] an exhaustive history of the print's interpretation in two volumes. His analysis, that Melencolia I is an ""elaborately wrought allegory of virtue ... structured through an almost diagrammatic opposition of virtue and fortune"", arrived as allegorical readings were coming into question.[58] In the 1980s, scholars began to focus on the inherent contradictions of the print, finding a mismatch between ""intention and result"" in the interpretive effort it seemingly required.[59] Martin Büchsel, in contrast to Panofsky, found the print a negation of Ficino's humanistic conception of melancholia.[59] The chaos of the print lends itself to modern interpretations that find it a comment on the limitations of reason, the mind and senses, and philosophical optimism.[59] For example, Dürer perhaps made the image impenetrable in order to simulate the experience of melancholia in the viewer.

Joseph Leo Koerner abandoned allegorical readings in his 1993 commentary, describing the engraving as purposely obscure, such that the viewer reflects on their own interpretive labour. He wrote, ""The vast effort of subsequent interpreters, in all their industry and error, testifies to the efficacy of the print as an occasion for thought. Instead of mediating a meaning, Melencolia seems designed to generate multiple and contradictory readings, to clue its viewers to an endless exegetical labor until, exhausted in the end, they discover their own portrait in Dürer's sleepless, inactive personification of melancholy. Interpreting the engraving itself becomes a detour to self-reflection.""[9]

In 2004, Patrick Doorly argued that Dürer was more concerned with beauty than melancholy. Doorly found textual support for elements of Melencolia I in Plato's Hippias Major, a dialog about what constitutes the beautiful, and other works that Dürer would have read in conjunction with his belief that beauty and geometry, or measurement, were related. (Dürer wrote a treatise on human proportions, one of his last major accomplishments.) Dürer was exposed to a variety of literature that may have influenced the engraving by his friend and collaborator, the humanist Willibald Pirckheimer, who also translated from Greek. In Plato's dialog, Socrates and Hippias consider numerous definitions of the beautiful. They ask if that which is pleasant to sight and hearing is the beautiful, which Dürer symbolizes by the intense gaze of the figure, and the bell, respectively. The dialog then examines the notion that the ""useful"" is the beautiful, and Dürer wrote in his notes, ""Usefulness is a part of beauty. Therefore what is useless in a man, is not beautiful."" Doorly interprets the many useful tools in the engraving as symbolizing this idea; even the dog is a ""useful"" hunting hound. At one point the dialog refers to a millstone, an unusually specific object to appear in both sources by coincidence. Further, Dürer may have seen the perfect dodecahedron as representative of the beautiful (the ""quintessence""), based on his understanding of Platonic solids. The ""botched"" polyhedron in the engraving therefore symbolises a failure to understand beauty, and the figure, standing in for the artist, is in a gloom as a result.[19]

In Perfection's Therapy (2017), Merback argues that Dürer intended Melencolia I as a therapeutic image. He reviews the history of images of spiritual consolation in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and highlights how Dürer expressed his ethical and spiritual commitment to friends and community through his art. He writes, the ""thematic of a virtue-building inner reflection, understood as an ethical-therapeutic imperative for the new type of pious intellectual envisioned by humanism, certainly underlies the conception of Melencolia"".[60] Dürer's friendships with humanists enlivened and advanced his artistic projects, building in him the ""self-conception of an artist with the power to heal"".[61] Treatments for melancholia in ancient times and in the Renaissance occasionally recognized the value of ""reasoned reflection and exhortation""[62] and emphasized the regulation of melancholia rather than its elimination ""so that it can better fulfill its God-given role as a material aid for the enhancement of human genius"".[63] The ambiguity of Melencolia I in this view ""offers a moderate mental workout that calms rather than excites the passions, a stimulation of the soul's higher powers, an evacuative that dispels the vapors beclouding the mind... This, in a word, is a form of katharsis—not in the medical or religious sense of a 'purgation' of negative emotions, but a 'clarification' of the passions with both ethical and spiritual consequences"".[64]

Artists from the sixteenth century used Melencolia I as a source, either in single images personifying melancholia or in the older type in which all four temperaments appear. Lucas Cranach the Elder used its motifs in numerous paintings between 1528 and 1533.[65][66] They share elements with Melencolia I such as a winged, seated woman, a sleeping or sitting dog, a sphere, and varying numbers of children playing, likely based on Durer's Putto. Cranach's paintings, however, contrast melancholy with childish gaiety, and in the 1528 painting, occult elements appear. Prints by Hans Sebald Beham (1539) and Jost Amman (1589) are clearly related. In the Baroque period, representations of Melancholy and Vanity were combined. Domenico Fetti's Melancholy/Meditation (c. 1620) is an important example; Panofsky et al. wrote that ""the meaning of this picture is obvious at first glance; all human activity, practical no less than theoretical, theoretical no less than artistic, is vain, in view of the vanity of all earthly things.""[67]

The print attracted  nineteenth-century Romantic artists; self-portrait drawings by Henry Fuseli and Caspar David Friedrich show their interest in capturing the mood of the Melencolia figure, as does Friedrich's The Woman with the Spider's Web.[68]

The Renaissance historian Frances Yates believed George Chapman's 1594 poem The Shadow of Night to be influenced by Dürer's print, and Robert Burton described it in his The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621).[66] Dürer's Melencolia is the patroness of the City of Dreadful Night in the final canto of James Thomson's poem of that name. The print was taken up in Romantic poetry of the nineteenth century in English and French.[69]

The Passion façade of the Sagrada Família contains a magic square based on[70] the magic square in Melencolia I. The square is rotated and one number in each row and column is reduced by one so the rows and columns add up to 33 instead of the standard 34 for a 4x4 magic square.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q654044,"The Portrait of a Clad Warrior, also known as Portrait of Gaston of Foix, is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian High Renaissance painter Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo, dating to c. 1529 and housed in the Louvre Museum, in Paris.

The subject was traditionally identified with the French military leader Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, or as a self-portrait, although there is no documentary evidence for either hypothesis. The identification with Gaston de Foix is devoid of documentary evidence, as well as certainly improbable, since it would have been a posthumous portrait lacking the composure more suited to this purpose. 

The painting depicts a man wearing military armor in a small room with two mirrors. In a narrow space, the man is portrayed leaning against a shelf, while he also leans forward towards the viewer, settling along a deep diagonal, which ends with his outstretched left arm, indicating the reflected image. The presence of the triple image (front, back and side) certainly refers to a lost painting by Giorgione, who had been created to demonstrate the superiority of painting in the lively debate on the ""comparison of the arts"". Savoldo, like Giorgione, wanted to demonstrate that painting was also capable of representing multiple views of the same subject, in the same way as sculpture, and without having to go around it.

The theme of light and reflections is also magnified by the metallic luster of the armor and the red velvet sleeves, which create those chromatic flashes between dense and dark shadow fields, typical of the painter's production.

The Age of Bronze (French: L'Âge d'airain) is a bronze statue by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840–1917). The figure is of a life-size nude male, 72 in. (182.9 cm) high. Rodin continued to produce casts of the statue for several decades after it was modelled in 1876.

Rodin had a Belgian soldier pose for the statue, keeping photographs which survive (in the Rodin Museum). The pose partly derives from Michelangelo's Dying Slave in the Louvre Museum, which has the elbow raised above the head.[citation needed]

When the statue was first exhibited at the 1877 Salon in Paris, France, Rodin was falsely accused of having made the statue by casting a living model, a charge that was vigorously denied. This charge benefited Rodin, though, because people were so eager to see this for themselves.[citation needed]

Casts of the statue can be found in many museums, including:

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5791685,"Christ on the Cross Adored by Two Donors is a c.1590 oil on canvas painting by El Greco, now in the Louvre, Paris.[1]

Intended for a chapel in the Hieronymite monastery in Toledo, it was commissioned by one of the two figures shown beneath the cross in the places usually occupied by the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist. These had previously been identified as the Covarrubias brothers, sons of the architect Alonso de Covarrubias, but now they are believed to be Dionisio Melgar on the left and an unknown inhabitant of Toledo (possibly Blas de Fuentechada or Pablo Rodríguez de Belalcázar) on the right.[2] Melgar was a canon of the aforementioned monastery and may have been one of the commissioners. It was still in the monastery in 1715, but was acquired by Louis Philippe of France in the 19th century. It appeared in the 1908 autumn salon in Paris, where it was acquired by its present owners.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3698197,"The Crucifixion is  a panel in the central part of the predella (see image below) of a large altarpiece painted by Andrea Mantegna between 1457 and 1459 for the high altar of San Zeno, Verona (Italy). It was commissioned by Gregorio Correr, the abbot of that monastery.

The Crucifixion was brought to the Louvre in 1798 and put on exhibition immediately. In 1806 two of the predella panels (the Mount of Olives and the Resurrection) were sent to the museum of Tours. In 1815 the central panel and the two wings were taken back to Italy and exhibited in the city museum at Verona. After 1918, they were returned to the church of San Zeno, where they still remain - though they are not very easy to see. The commission of 1815 charged with reclaiming the works of art taken from the Veneto left the predella panels in the possession of the Louvre and the museum of Tours.[1]

The Crucifixion was in the middle of the predella, exactly in the centre, as may be seen in the full altarpiece image below. Mantegna was striving after an effect of steep visual perspective such as he had already achieved in the Eremitani chapel at Padua.[2] The figures in the foreground, cut by the frame, increase the effect of recession; the vanishing lines of the ground are curved inwards and somehow contracted. The artist's feeling for nature is revealed by the minuteness with which he has represented every detail of the landscape. The accurate delineation of the Roman soldiers' equipment is evidence of an attitude to antiquity unknown in Florence at that period.[3] Florentine artists sought to understand and emulate the aesthetic quality of antique sculpture and architecture, but cared little for historical exactitude, which Mantegna on the other hand pursued with the passionate devotion of an archaeologist. In fact, the Veneto was from the 14th century onwards, the chief Italian centre for the traffic in anticaglie - Venetian towns owned cabinets d'antiquités long before these were found in Florence.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3224317,"The Mystic  Marriage of St. Francis is a  painting by the  Italian Renaissance artist Sassetta, now in the Musée Condé of Chantilly, France.

The painting by Stefano di Giovanni di Consolo, known as il Sassetta (ca.1392–1450 or 1451) was originally part of a polyptych at Sansepolcro, where it was seen by Piero della Francesca.

It portrays St. Francis of Assisi while ideally marrying the three Theological Virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity, through the donation of a ring to them. The three virtues have differently colored dresses: red for Charity, green for Hope and white for Faith. Behind St. Francis, who wears his traditional brown monk habit, is his companion Fra' Leone.

Alternatively, the painting illustrates the public pronouncement of St. Francis's vows according to the evangelical counsels of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience. Poverty, barefoot, is central of the three female figures, the ring being slipped on her finger as Francis makes his vow of poverty, or perfect charity; Chastity is in white, and Obedience in red. As the three women leave, Poverty glances back, her bare feet more evident. Obedience, who stood with her arms crossed during the marriage ceremony, bears away a rood cross, both symbols of the cross of Christ and that which Francis will bear as token of his obedience. Chastity bears away the lilies of purity. Poverty carries (what appears to be) a palm frond, emblematic of entry into monastic order, and the victory of spirit over flesh.

The scene is set in an idyllic landscape, between hills, castles and cultivated fields, without any attention to perspective and realism as in other Renaissance works. Sassetta was in fact one of the last painters of the Sienese Gothic school, as shown by the use of elongated figures, the delicate colors and the courtly atmosphere.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q521671,"Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon is an oil painting of the mid-15th century that is considered one of the outstanding works of art of the late Middle Ages. Following its appearance at an exhibition in 1904 its authorship was disputed, though it has since been accepted as the work of Enguerrand Quarton. It is now in the Musée du Louvre.

The Pietà, where the dead Christ is supported by his grieving mother, is a common theme of late-medieval religious art, but this is one of the most striking depictions, ""perhaps the greatest masterpiece produced in France in the 15th century"" (Edward Lucie-Smith).[1] It is distinctive from previous depictions of the subject—which were often characterized by overt displays of grief and trauma—by virtue of its restraint. The composition is stable, with the Virgin's hands together in prayer, rather than clutching the body of Christ.[2] The curved back form of Christ's body is highly original, and the stark, motionless dignity of the other figures is very different from Italian or Netherlandish depictions. The style of the painting is unique for its time: the grouping of the figures appears somewhat primitive, yet the conception evidences both great breadth and delicacy, the latter quality especially evident in the specificity of the portraits and the elegant gesture of St. John's hands at Christ's head.[3]

The bare background landscape falls away to a horizon broken by the buildings of Jerusalem, but instead of a sky there is plain gold leaf with stamped and incised haloes, borders and inscriptions. The clerical donor, portrayed with Netherlandish realism, kneels to the left.  The painting came from Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, just across the Rhône from Avignon, and is sometimes known as the ""Villeneuve Pietà"".
It can also be suggested that the buildings depicted on the left background are an imaginary representation of Istanbul and the church of Hagia Sophia. The city had fallen to the Ottomans in 1453, a few years before the estimated creation of the painting and the main subject (Pieta) can be considered as a lament to the fall of the eastern part of Christendom.

Before its widely accepted attribution to Quarton, some art historians thought the painting might be by a Catalan or Portuguese master; it was, according to art historian Lawrence Gowing, ""the subject of dispute among protagonists of every school along the seaboard between Lisbon and Messina.""[4] Quarton, known to be working in Avignon by 1447, painted two pictures there in the early 1450s which bear comparison to this painting.[3]

For Gowing,

The agony of the picture is suffered with a rare restraint. No demonstrative expression could match the tragedy of this body, distended as if dreaming. We are in the presence of the simplicity of sorrow. Against the bare skyline, in the gray-gold of the medieval twilight, the scene seems inexpressibly grand.[3]"
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18397036,"Landscape with a Castle is an oil-on-panel painting by Rembrandt, now in the Louvre in Paris. Art historians have variously dated it to 1652 (Rein van Eysinga), 1654 (Frederik Schmidt-Degener), early 1640 (Abraham Bredius and Horst Gerson), 1648 (Kurt Bauch), 1640-1642 (Jacques Foucart), c.1640 (Christian Tümpel) and 1643–1646 (Leonard J. Slatkes).

It is first recorded in the 1692 inventory of Geertruyt Brasser in Delft as ""a castle by Rembrandt"" (Brasser was the widow of Johan van der Chys). It was later recorded in the collection of Jan Pieter van Suchtelen, a Russian general from the Netherlands. In 1859 van Suchtelen's heirs sold it to Pavel Stroganov in St-Petersburg. On his death in 1911 Stroganov left it and the rest of his art collection to Vladimir and Aleksandra Shcherbatov, the children of his brother's daughter. Vladimir and Aleksandra were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1920, three years after their artworks had been seized by the state. 

By 1925 at the latest the work had been moved to the Hermitage Museum, but in 1932 it was secretly sold off by the USSR, probably via the art dealer Wildenstein and Company. In 1933 it was probably sold to the Parisian collector Étienne Nicolas, in whose collection it definitively appeared in 1935. In 1942 Nicolas sold it and Portrait of Titus van Rijn to Adolf Hitler via the Berlin-based art dealer Karl Haberstock for 60 million francs – Hitler intended it for his Führermuseum in Linz. After the war's end it was returned to Nicolas via the Central Collecting Point and in 1948 he donated it to the Louvre.

The Massacre at Chios (French: Scène des massacres de Scio) is the second major oil painting by the French artist Eugène Delacroix.[A] The work is more than four meters tall, and shows some of the horror of the wartime destruction visited on the Island of Chios in the Chios massacre. A frieze-like display of suffering characters, military might, ornate and colourful costumes, terror, disease and death is shown in front of a scene of widespread desolation.

Unusual for a painting of civil ruin during this period, The Massacre at Chios has no heroic figure to counterbalance the crushed victims, and there is little to suggest hope among the ruin and despair. The vigour with which the aggressor is painted, contrasted with the dismal rendition of the victims, has drawn comment since the work was first hung, and some critics have charged that Delacroix might have tried to show some sympathy with the brutal occupiers.[1] The painting was completed and displayed at the Salon of 1824 and hangs at the Musée du Louvre in Paris.[2]

A military attack on the inhabitants of Chios by Ottoman forces commenced on 12 April 1822 and was prosecuted for several months into the summer of the same year. The campaign resulted in the deaths of twenty thousand citizens, and the forced deportation into slavery of almost all the surviving seventy thousand inhabitants.[3][4][5]

Delacroix had been greatly impressed by his fellow Parisien Théodore Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa, a painting for which he himself modeled as the young man at the front with the outstretched arm. The pyramidal arrangement that governs Géricault's painting is similarly seen with the figures in the foreground of The Massacre at Chios.[6] On this unlikely layout of characters, Delacroix commented, ""One must fill up; if it is less natural, it will be more beautiful and fécond. Would that everything should hold together!""[7] The dense assembly of characters at the front is in marked contrast to the open and dispersed spaces behind them. Land and sea, light and shade appear as bands of drifting colours listlessly running into each other, and Delacroix appears to abandon the laws of perspective altogether with his rendering of clouds. The complete effect of this background is to suggest a constant opening out, dissolution and centrelessness. Aesthetician Heinrich Wölfflin identified this technique, and classified it a tectonic form.[8]

The thirteen civilians—men, women and children–have been rounded up for slaughter or enslavement. They are harshly presented to the viewer in an almost flat plane; slumped, disordered, and unevenly distributed. Their arrangement principally comprises two human pyramids–one pyramid to the left of the canvas culminating in the man with the red fez, and the other to the right culminating in the mounted soldier. The area between the two pyramids contains two soldiers in shadow, and two more Greek victims–a young man embraced by a young woman. The two men in the pyramid to the left are injured. The man at the front is on or near to the point of death, and the man poised at the top of the group appears unable to prepare a defence for himself. His gaze is in the direction of the suffering children in front of him, but it does not fall on them. This seeming detachment, coupled with the vacant stare of the dying man lend to this group an air of despondent resignation.

In contrast, the human pyramid to the right has a vigorous vertical thrust. The writhing of the woman tied to the horse, the upward reaching stretch of the figure to her left, the shocking mane of the horse, and the twisting and commanding figure of the soldier upon it, all give dynamism to the grouping as it rises. But at the foot of the pyramid, an old woman raises her head to gaze into the sky, and to her right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant.

Of the rear, Elisabeth A. Fraser notes that ""[t]he background cuts through the centre of the composition and drops inexplicably out and back from the cluster of [foreground] figures."" This dramatic arrangement breaks the picture apart into fragments, with clumps of tangled bodies, scattered glances and other details competing for the viewers attention.[9] In the middle distance, another mêlée of humanitarian disaster unfolds, and the background is an uneven display of sacked, burning settlements and scorched earth. Most of the Mediterranean horizon is painted with bleak earth colours, and it is punctuated only by smoke, the mane of the rearing horse and the head of the soldier.

Delacroix reveals over a number of weeks' entries in his Journal a desire to try to get away from the academically sound and muscular figures of his previous work Dante and Virgil in Hell.[10][11][12] Two studies Delacroix worked on at this time, Head of an Old Greek Woman and Girl Seated in a Cemetery, show the combination of unexaggerated modelling and accented contour he was striving to incorporate into his larger work. The final treatment of figures in the Massacre is however less consistent than these two studies. The flesh of the dead (or dying) man at the front is for instance strongly colouristically rendered, contrasting with the more tonal modelling of the nude to the right, and the Veronese-like schematic modelling of the baby.[13]

On 15 September 1821, Delacroix wrote to his friend Raymond Soulier that he wanted to make a reputation for himself by painting a scene from the war between the Ottomans and the Greeks, and have this painting displayed at the Salon. At this time Delacroix was not famous, and had yet to paint a canvas that was to be hung for public display. In the event, he decided to paint his Dante and Virgil in Hell, but even as this painting was revealed to the public in April 1822, the atrocities at Chios were being meted out in full force. In May 1823, Delacroix committed to paint a picture about the massacre.

When the Salon of 1824 opened on 25 August—an unusually late date for this institution—Delacroix's picture was shown there as exhibit no. 450 and entitled Scènes des massacres de Scio; familles grecques attendent la mort ou l'esclavage, etc.  (English:Scenes of massacres at Chios; Greek families awaiting death or slavery, etc..) The painting was hung in the same room that housed Ingres' The Vow of Louis XIII. This display of two works exemplifying such different approaches to the expression of form marked the beginning of the public rivalry between the two artists. Delacroix thought this was the moment the academy began to regard him as an ""object of antipathy"".[14]

Alexandre Dumas reported that ""there is always a group in front of the picture ..., painters of every school engaged in heated discussion"". Both Dumas and Stendhal remarked that they thought the picture was a depiction of a plague, which in part it was. Gros, from whose Plague of Jaffa Delacroix had noticeably borrowed, called it ""the massacre of painting"".[15] Ingres said the painting exemplified the 'fever and epilepsy' of modern art.[16] Critics Girodet and Thiers were, however, more flattering, and the painting was sufficiently well regarded for the state to purchase it the same year for the Musée du Luxembourg for 6000 francs. The purchase provoked internal conflicts in the Restoration arts administration, however, when the Comte de Forbin, director of the royal museums, bought the painting without the King's official approval, an irregular and politically risky procedure.[17] In November 1874 it was transferred to the Musée du Louvre.[18]

Naturally, Delacroix's painting aroused considerable attention in Greece. A draft of this painting, created under the supervision of Delacroix in his lab by one of his students, is in display in the Athens War Museum. In 2009, a copy of the painting was displayed in the local Byzantine museum on Chios. It was withdrawn from the museum in November 2009 in a ""good faith initiative"" for the improvement of Greek-Turkish relations. However, the Greek press protested its removal.[19][20] The copy is now back on display in the museum.

It adopts the sacred conversation theme then popular in northern Italy but rarer in Northern European painting of the time, also lacking the latter's usual side panels.[3] It was commissioned for his family chapel by Jacques Florence (in Flemish Jacob Floreins), a spice merchant in Bruges, who died there in 1488. It was very probably completed after Floreins' death, since his wife is shown dressed as a widow.[4]

Saint James was Jacques' name saint, whilst Saint Dominic was probably chosen since one of his daughters had become a Dominican nun and is shown dressed as one. The background is divided into three parts, with the scene placed in a church setting as sometimes seen in Jan van Eyck's work, though unlike in van Eyck it here opens out onto the exterior.[5] To the left is a street and a cityscape, contrasting with the more rural landscape to the right.[6]

The work may have inspired Hans Holbein the Younger's Darmstadt Madonna[7] and its portrayal of a husband and wife facing each other with their children has also been compared with the Funk family epitaph attributed to Bernhard Strigel and now in the Schaffhouse in Switzerland, though this latter work lacks the saints and the Madonna and Child. Memling's work seems to have been taken to Spain thanks to the wishes of Jacob Floreins' Spanish widow, whose family was based in Burgos. General Jean Barthélemy Darmagnac was based in Burgos and looted the painting from there in 1808 during the French occupation of Spain. It was then acquired from him by count Duchâtel, whose wife then left it to its current owner in 1878.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2478403,"Portrait of Princess is a tempera painting on panel attributed to the Italian Late-Gothic master Pisanello. It was probably executed between 1435 and 1445 and is also known as Portrait of a Princess of the House of Este.  It is firmly attributed to Pisanello on stylistic grounds and because he stayed in Ferrara in the period, where he also finished a portrait and a celebrative medal of Marquis Leonello d'Este.

The princess is shown in profile against a background of numerous butterflies and columbine flowers. The butterfly (it seems a Vanessa atalanta) near the princess' brow is a symbol of the soul.

The painting is currently housed and exhibited in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France.

This picture first came to light in 1860 in a sale, when it was bought by the German Consul Felix Bamberg. In 1893 the Louvre acquired it from Charles Picard for 30000 francs.

For a long time there has been no doubt in anyone's mind as to the name of the artist; but the identity of the sitter remains a mystery. The portrait represents a very young woman, hardly more than a girl. Against the background of greenery, with its sprinkling of butterflies, pinks and columbines, the profile is sharply defined. Her hair is styled to create the appearance of a high, round forehead, an attribute of beauty in Renaissance Italy.[1] Women of this era frequently plucked their eyebrows, hairlines, and drew hair tightly away from the face to accentuate this quality. [2]

The only solid basis for a hypothesis of identification is the embroidery on her sleeve, representing the two-handled vase of the Este family; this is also found on the reverse of a medal which Pisanello designed for Lionello d'Este. Attempts have therefore been made to connect the portrait with various princesses of this family. Pisanello was one of the artists employed by them, and stayed on several occasions in Ferrara (Italy), where he decorated a room in the Palazzo Schifanoia.

Margherita Gonzaga (d. 1439) might be one possibility for the sitter. She was the wife of Lionello d'Este, and the picture might have been painted at the time of their marriage in 1433. Another suggestion identifies this fresh and young face as Ginevra d'Este, because of the sprig of juniper on the sleeve - though this may simply be an emblem of happiness and not a pun on her name. She was the unfortunate niece and wife of the redoubtable Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, who subjected Romagna to fire and arms, and whose shameless affaire with Isotta degli Atti was the scandal of the age. It was Malatesta who commissioned polymath Leon Battista Alberti to build the Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini. He had his wife poisoned in 1440, when she was only twenty-two. It has also been suggested that the lady in the portrait may be a Gonzaga princess: perhaps Beatrice, or Margherita, or the learned Cecilia, whom Pisanello also depicted on a medal (cf. image at right).[3]

Gian Lorenzo Berti is a portrait painting Neapolitan Italian Rococo painter Gaspare Traversi. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 182.[2]

The painting depicts the Augustinian theologian Giovanni Lorenzo Berti (also known as Gianlorenzo Berti, or Gian Lorenzo Berti), and was painted in Rome between 1754 and 1756. It was bought for the museum in 1890 by Wilhelm von Bode, from the collection of Gustave Rothan [da], together with Ribera's Saint Peter and Saint Paul.[1][2]

On account of its severity and its stateliness, this 18th-century portrait painting was at first thought to be a work by the 17th-century painter Andrea Sacchi, who had in fact preceded Traversi by several generations. It was attributed to Traversi by Roberto Longhi in 1922; Longhi would later heap fulsome praise on the painting, calling it ""one of the most beautiful portraits of the whole 18th century"" in a 1927 article full of enthusiastic descriptions.

Regatta at Molesey near Hampton Court is an 1874 painting by Alfred Sisley, now in the Musée d'Orsay, to which it was allocated in 1986.[1] It was left to the French state by the painter and collector Gustave Caillebotte in 1894, and previously hung in the Musée du Luxembourg (1896-1929), the main building at the Louvre (1929-1947), and the Louvre's galerie du Jeu de Paume (1947-1986).[2]

The work shows the Molesey Regatta, begun by an amateur sportsman in 1873 and still in existence. Sisley produced it during a four-month stay in England,[3] funded and accompanied by his patron the art collector Jean-Baptiste Faure.[4] Paradoxically, in usually cloudier England, Sisley's paintings became brighter and more festive.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q931837,"Christ at the Column (also known as The Flagellation of Christ; c. 1606/1607), is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio, now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, Rouen, France.

This is one of two versions of the Flagellation of Christ by Caravaggio painted late in 1606 or early in 1607, soon after his arrival in Naples. The painting shows the flagellation of Christ following his arrest and trial and before his crucifixion. The scene was traditionally depicted in front of a column, possibly alluding to the judgement hall of Pilate. The snub-nosed torturer on the far right is recognisably the same figure who modelled as one of the torturers in The Flagellation of Christ, and as the executioner in Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

The most famous treatment of the theme at the time was Sebastiano del Piombo's High Renaissance Flagellation of Christ in the church of San Pietro in Montorio in Rome. Piombo's Flagellation, much imitated by later artists, shows multiple idealised figures twisting through complex layers of space. Caravaggio has flattened the space, reduced the figures to a minimum, and used light to direct attention to the crucial parts of his composition - Christ's face and torso, the faces of the two torturers, and the hand holding the out-of-frame whip.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15934368,"Allegory of Wealth is a circa 1640[1] painting by the French Baroque artist Simon Vouet. Allegory of Wealth is its traditional title, though Nicolas Milovanovic argues that it should instead be entitled Allegory of Contempt for Wealth and the Louvre (where it now hangs) entitles it Allegory of Faith and of Contempt for Wealth.

Probably painted for Louis XIII's château at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, it is first mentioned in the French royal collection inventories early in the 18th century as Victory crowned with laurels holding in her arms an infant with a sash and an infant holding bracelets and precious stones. Frédéric Villot entitled it La Richesse in the mid-19th century and this title was not contested until 2015.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24160,"The Braque Triptych (or the Braque Family Triptych) is a c. 1452 oil-on-oak altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. When open, its three half-length panels reveal, from left to right, John the Baptist, The Virgin Mary with Jesus and Saint John the Evangelist, and on the right, Mary Magdalene. When the wings are closed, the work shows a vanitas motif of a skull and cross.

The Braque Triptych is the only surviving devotional work by van der Weyden known to be painted for private rather than public  display.[1] The altarpiece was probably commissioned by either Jehan Braque of Tournai or, more likely, his wife Catherine de Brabant – possibly after Jehan's sudden and early death in 1452. The couple had been married for only a brief period. Catherine was much younger than her husband; when they married in 1450 or early 1451, she was 20 and some 12 or 13 years his junior. She evidently held a deep and lasting affection for him. When she died, almost 50 years after him, she had asked to be buried alongside him, despite remarrying years earlier.[2]

Inscription and free floating text play a major role in the work. Each interior panel contains Latin inscriptions issuing from the figures' mouths or floating above them, serving as either speech bubbles or commentary. They are echoed by the words inscribed on the cross of the left exterior panel. The texts are all taken from the Gospel of John, except for that of the Virgin's, which comes from the Gospel of Luke. The words of John the Baptist curve upwards from his mouth to the top right corner of the frame, and seem to join those of the Virgin in the center panel, which in turn flow along the top of the center panel.[3]

The words of the Magdalen, in contrast, form a flat horizontal line, breaking the curved left to right continuity of the text of the left and central panels. Similarly The Magdalene's words differ from that of the other panels; they are not uttered by her and instead consist as a detached commentary on her. It is perhaps because of this that they are not rendered with, as art historian Alfred Acres puts it, the ""sinuous grace"" of the others, as they are ""words written of the Magdalene not spoken or written by her.""[4] Her text, from John 12:3, reads Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus.[4]

Van der Weyden had used the technique of floating inscriptions earlier, notably in the center panel of his c. 1445–50  Beaune Altarpiece, where words appear to float in the pictorial space or are seemingly sewn into the clothes of the figures.[5]

The left panel is a half-length depiction of John the Baptist,[6] with a background showing a scene from the baptism of Christ. John's words float above him as a curved speech balloon which emits from his mouth. The words, taken from John 1:29, read ""Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world"".[7] In the right hand panel Mary Magdalene is depicted in sumptuous and highly detailed dress in an image considered to be one of the finest of van der Weyden's female portraits. At 68 cm wide, the center panel is almost twice the breadth of the left and right panels. It shows Christ Salvator Mundi,[8] his head a near-replica of his depiction in the Last Judgment triptych.[1] The center panel acts as a ""picture within a picture"", the context of which is ""narrated"" by the balloons from the mouths of John and Mary.

John the Evangelist and Jesus' right hands are raised in the traditional Christian pose or gesture of the teacher. Their index and middle fingers are held upright while their two small fingers are close to their thumbs.[9] The hand gestures and fingers of each saint are arranged in a highly deliberate and symmetrical manner. The pattern they form across the three interior panels echoes the narrative of the triptych as indicated by the balloons. However, the flow is interrupted in the Magdalene panel, her hand is raised vertically as if a barrier to the other panels, while her text is in a straight horizontal rather than curved.

When the wings are closed across the central panel, the exterior reveals a memento mori[10] or vanitas motif of a skull and cross with is decorated with Latin inscriptions. The outer left hand wing shows a yellow-brown skull leaning against a broken brick or stone fragment[11] alongside the coat of arms of the Braque family – a sheaf of wheat – seen on the upper right portion of the panel.[1] It has been suggested that the skull is a future state representation of the viewer.[1][12]

The panel is one of the earliest known examples of a skull used in a vanitas, while the broken brick, cross and inscriptions present imagery of death and decay typical of the genre.[13]  Brick in such works usually symbolise ruin, either of buildings or a dynasties, in this case given the inclusion of the Braque family crest, it can be assumed to serve as reminder to members of the latter.[14]  Other art historians believe that the skull may not have been symbolically relevant to the Braque family, as they were well-established as advisers and financiers to the House of Valois.[1] Instead, the argue, it may represent Adam, or a piece of Golgotha.[1]

The right panel contains a cross with a Latin inscription based on Ecclesiasticus XLI: 1–2. The words read as o mors quam amara est memoria tua homini pacem habenti in substantiis suis. viro quieto et cuius viae directae sunt in omnibus et adhuc valenti accipere cibum (O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions! To a man that is at rest, and whose ways are prosperous in all things, and that is yet able to take meat!).

The approximate dating of the triptych is based the death of Jehan Braque in 1452,[15] and the fact that the interior panels show an Italian influence, and is considered one of the first of his later more austere mature period works; van der Wyeden had visited Italy in 1450.

It is first mentioned, unattributed, in Catherine de Brabant's 1497 will when she left it to her grandson Jehan Villain. Records show the altarpiece in the possession of her heirs until 1586, after which it was purchased by a priest in England. It later came into the possession of the English painter Richard Evans. It was purchased by the Musée du Louvre from the writer and benefactor Lady Theodora Guest, in 1913.[16] At the time, it was considered the most important acquisition by the public gallery since 1878 when they were bequeathed a major work by Hans Memling. At the time it was a record price paid for a van der Weyden; J. P. Morgan had earlier spent $100,000 on the Annunciation now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.[7][17][18]

Today it is on permanent display in the Louvre, in its original oak frame. Because of its fragility, it is encased in glass.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q538243,"The Small Holy Family (c. 1518–1519) is an oil-on-panel painting by Raphael and assistants, now in the Louvre in Paris. Its name distinguishes it from his Great Holy Family, also in the Louvre. It is signed and dated ""RAPHAEL VRBINAS S[anti] PINGEBAT MDXVIII"" on the hem of the Madonna's garment.[1]

According to the 17th century writer André Félibién two further Louvre works Abundance and Ceres, both in monochrome, formed a cover to the Small Holy Family. Abundance has a signature ""Raphael Uvrbinas"", though this is usually considered a later addition. It may relate to cardinal Bibbiena, whose surname was ""Dovizi[a]"" (i.e. Abundance). It is a rare survival of a painting for so small a painting. It shows a figure in a niche on a base between marble mirrors, with a mask under the base, referring to an Aphrodite (Kunsthistorisches Museum) originally in the Loggia dei Marmi in the Palazzo Ducale di Mantova.[2][3]

The work and its cover may have been commissioned from Raphael around 1519 by Pope Leo X as thanks for the services of Adrien Gouffier de Boissy, papal legate to France. de Boissy also owned John the Baptist as a Young Man in the Desert (Louvre), another work by Raphael and assistants, as well as a preparatory drawing for the Small Holy Family now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. In 1622 it was recorded in the collection of the Count of Brienne, who then left it to Louis XIV.

Elizabeth's face and the cradle in the shape of an inverted tree trunk are reminiscent of other works by Raphael from that era such as Holy Family under an Oak Tree (Prado) and La Perla (Prado), both with assistance from Giulio Romano. The background landscape is influenced by the Danubian School.

The Denial of Saint Peter is a 1650 painting of the Denial of Peter by Georges de La Tour, possibly with some assistance from the painter's son Étienne.[1] It was signed and dated by the senior artist. In 1810 it was acquired from François Cacault by the musée d'Arts de Nantes, where it still hangs.[2][3]

The work was commissioned by Henri de La Ferté-Senneterre, governor of Lorraine, where La Tour lived and worked.[4] de La Ferté-Senneterre is recorded as paying 650 francs for a work entitled The Denial of St Peter in 1650, possibly the work now in Nantes. He was then one of the most important collectors of La Tour's work.[5]

The work's approach is very Caravagist, sidelining the work's supposed main subject and placing the soldiers gaming at a table at its centre.[1] In 17th century French society, ""gaming was inseparable from luxury""[6] and was evidence of ""indifference to salvation"" - a similar link is made in the artist's The Card Sharp with the Ace of Diamonds, contemporary with Tristan L'Hermite's The Disgraced Page.[6] The gaming soldiers also refer forwards in time to those casting lots for Jesus' clothing at the foot of the cross.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3202169,"The Apotheosis of Homer is a grand 1827 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, now exhibited at the Louvre as INV 5417. The symmetrical composition depicts Homer being crowned by a winged figure personifying Victory or the Universe. Forty-four additional figures pay homage to the poet in a kind of classical confession of faith. 

A state commission to decorate a ceiling of the musée Charles X at the Louvre (now the ancient Egyptian galleries), it formed part of a renovation project commissioned by Charles X to have himself remembered in the grand tradition of Bourbon building works at the Louvre. A condition of the commission was that it was to be completed within a year's time.[1] Upon receiving the commission, Ingres conceived the idea for his painting quickly—it was a source of pride to him that he had required only an hour to establish the broad outlines of his composition in a sketch.[1] The subsequent care he took in developing his idea is evident in more than 100 drawings and numerous painted sketches for it that survive, in which he fixed the details more and more precisely. Ingres's level of research can be seen in the painting's portrait of Nicolas Poussin, which is directly copied from Poussin's 1650 self-portrait now in the Louvre. 

The composition is a symmetrical grouping centered in a classical way in front of an ancient Greek temple. The painting's catalogue entry at the time of its first exhibition described it as ""Homer receiving homage from all the great men of Greece, Rome and modern times. The Universe crowns him, Herodotus burns incense.[2] The Iliad and Odyssey sit at his feet.""

The final painting's colours are very fresh and clear, giving the impression of fresco. Ingres wished to compete with Raphael through this painting (it is strongly inspired by the Italian artist's Parnassus) and Raphael is to be seen top left (in black and white Renaissance dress), being led by Apelles (in a blue cloak). Other figures shown include Dante who is shown being led by Virgil as in the former's Divine Comedy (extreme left, behind Poussin) and Molière (right, by the feet of the personification of the Odyssey).

The art historian Robert Rosenblum said The Apotheosis of Homer represents ""Ingres' most doctrinaire statement of his belief in a hierarchy of timeless values that are based on classical precedent.""[3] It is highly successful in its genre, though leaves an impression of coldness, an impression which was reinforced at the time of its production by the exhibition of Delacroix's The Death of Sardanapalus at the same year's Paris Salon. Ingres had been considered revolutionary early in his career, but this contrast now faced off a Romantic renewal under Delacroix against the purest classical tradition as shown by Ingres. The Apotheosis of Homer was taken down from its initial site in 1855 and replaced later that year with a copy by Paul and Raymond Balze (in collaboration with Michel Dumas).[4]

Surrounding Homer are poets, artists, and philosophers both ancient and modern—the modern personages are mostly confined to the lower register of the composition, although Ingres deemed Raphael and Michelangelo worthy of elevation to stand alongside the ancients. The figures are:[5]

Ingres revisited the subject in several later works, including an undated watercolour (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts) and paintings such as Homer and His Guide (1861; Brussels, Royal Collection) and The Odyssey (Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts). In 1854 be began work on a drawing of the composition to be used as a model for the engraver Calamatta.[6] This drawing, in which Ingres announced his intention to ""amplify and complete"" his conception, was not completed until 1865,[6] as the artist deliberated at length in choosing the appropriate historical personages to be included. He ultimately added dozens of new figures, including Ictinus, Giulio Romano, John Flaxman, Jacques-Louis David, Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Cosimo de Medici, Louis XIV, and Pope Leo X.[5] Ingres also refined his selection by excluding Shakespeare, Tasso, and Camões from the 1865 drawing, as he had come to believe that they were too closely related to the Romantic tendency epitomized by his rival Delacroix.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1133821,"The Death of Sardanapalus (La Mort de Sardanapale) is an oil painting on canvas by Eugène Delacroix, dated 1827. It currently hangs in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.[1] A smaller replica, painted by Delacroix in 1844, is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.[2]

The Death of Sardanapalus is based on the tale of Sardanapalus, a king of Assyria, from the historical library of Diodorus Siculus, the ancient Greek historian, and is a work of the era of Romanticism. This painting uses rich, vivid and warm colours, and broad brushstrokes. It was inspired by Lord Byron's play Sardanapalus (1821), and in turn inspired a cantata by Hector Berlioz, Sardanapale (1830), and also Franz Liszt's opera, Sardanapalo (1845–1852, unfinished).

The main focus of Death of Sardanapalus is a large bed draped in rich red fabric. On it lies a man with a disinterested eye overseeing a scene of chaos. He is dressed in flowing white fabrics and sumptuous gold around his neck and head. A woman lies dead at his feet, prone across the lower half of the large bed. She is one of six in the scene, all in various shades of undress, and all in assorted throes of death by the hands of the half dozen men in the scene. There are several people being stabbed with knives and one man is dying from a self-inflicted wound from a sword, and a man in the left foreground is attempting to kill an intricately adorned horse. A young man by the king's right elbow is standing behind a side table which has an elaborate golden decanter and a cup. There are golden elephant heads at the base of the bed, as well as various valuable trinkets scattered amongst the carnage. In the background, several architectural elements are visible but difficult to discern.

Delacroix used a painterly brushstroke in this painting, which allows for a strong sense of movement in the work. This scene is chaotic and violent, as showcased by the movement, weapons, and the colors used. The redness of the bed stands out against the somewhat obscured, dark background. The whiteness of Sardanapalus's robe, the creamy lines of the dying women's limbs, and the shimmers of gold objects throughout the scene pull the viewer's eye quickly around the painting.

There is asymmetry in the work, but the composition remains balanced. One woman reclined by an elephant head on the end of the bed is the only figure to engage with the viewer. Everyone else in the painting is focused on the task at hand: death.

Delacroix's Death of Sardanapalus was controversial and polarizing at its exhibition at the Paris Salon of 1828. Delacroix's main figural subject was Sardanapalus, a king willing to destroy all of his possessions, including people and luxurious goods, in a funerary pyre of gore and excess.[3] Sardanapalus was not a classical hero, like the Horatii in Jacques-Louis David’s eponymous painting. Delacroix's Sardanapalus was the antithesis of neoclassical traditions, which favored subdued colors, rigid space, and an overall moral subject matter. He also used foreshortening to tilt the death scene directly into the space of the audience, a far cry from the subdued order of traditional academic paintings. Dorothy Bussy quotes one critic of the work as calling the painting ""the fanaticism of ugliness"" when it appeared in the Salon in 1828.[4]

Linda Nochlin has argued that this painting scandalized the salon because it was understood by contemporaries as a destructive sexual fantasy of Delacroix's own--a collapse of the distinction between the ""Other"" of Orientalism (i.e., Sardanapalus) and western man.[5]

The composer Franz Liszt was inspired by Delacroix's painting (and Byron's play) to compose an Italian opera--Sardanapalo--on the topic, telling Princess Cristina Belgiojoso that, in view of the king's self-immolation, his finale will aim to 'set the entire audience alight'.[6] He completed Act 1 only in 1852 and abandoned the project thereafter. The completed first act received its premiere in 2018.[7][8]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q405814,"Ship of Fools (painted c. 1490–1500) is a painting by Hieronymus Bosch, now  in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. Camille Benoit donated it in 1918. The Louvre restored it in 2015. The surviving painting is a fragment of a triptych that was cut into several parts. The Ship of Fools was painted on one of the wings of the altarpiece, and is about two-thirds of its original length. The bottom third of the panel belongs to Yale University Art Gallery and is exhibited under the title Allegory of Gluttony. The other wing, which has more or less retained its full length, is the Death and the Miser, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. The two panels together would have represented the two extremes of prodigality and miserliness, condemning and caricaturing both. The Wayfarer(Rotterdam) was painted on the right panel rear of the triptych. The central panel, if it existed, is unknown.

Dendrochronological study has dated the wood to 1491, and it is tempting to see the painting as a response to Sebastian Brant's Das Narrenschiff or even the illustrations of the first edition of 1493. Another possible source for the ship allegory is the 14th-century Le Pèlerinage de l'Âme by Guillaume de Deguileville, which was printed in Dutch in 1486 (shortly after William Caxton printed it as The Pylgremage of the Sowle in 1483).[1]

A Drawing of the Ship of Fools [nl], also in the Louvre, appears to be a later copy.

Dendrochronological studies[2] by Peter Klein have radically altered the provenance of some paintings, for instance the Escorial Crowning with Thorns panel can only have been painted after 1525 and so is not a Bosch original. The same goes for the Rotterdam Marriage feast at Cana panel which can only have been painted after 1553. It has also become clear that the Rotterdam Pedlar tondo, the Paris Ship of Fools panel and the Washington Death of a Miser panel have been painted on wood from the same tree.

The two to eight years between the felling of the tree and  its use as a painting substrate allows The Ship of Fools to be a direct satire of a frontispiece[3] of Sebastian Brant's book.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17177339,"Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword was originally a painting of 1814 in the Troubador style by the French artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, showing the Spanish ambassador Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca kissing the sword of Henry IV of France (held by a young page) in the salle des Caryatides of the Louvre Palace. The 1814 painting is now lost. Between 1819 and 1832, Ingres painted three additional versions of the subject.


Episodes from the life of Henri IV were a frequent subject for French painters in Ingres' time.[1] The incident depicted in this painting was described by Ingres in one of his notebooks:
One day Don Pedro of Toledo, the Ambassador of Spain to the court of Henri IV, saw in the Louvre the sword of the King in the hands of a young page. Advancing, he knelt on the ground and kissed it, rendering honor, he said, to the most glorious sword in Christendom.[1]
The artist painted four versions of the subject between 1814 and 1832.

The original version was painted in 1814 and exhibited at the Paris Salon that year, where it was disparaged by critics.[2] After even Ingres' friends found fault with it, Ingres reworked it in 1820. The revised composition included the figures of the Duc d'Epernon and Gabrielle d'Estrées behind the ambassador and the page.[3] The location of the painting since the mid-19th century is unknown.[2] The composition of the painting before its revision is recorded in an engraving by Achille Réveil published in 1851.[3]

A second version (1819; now at the château de Pau)[4] was painted for Ingres' friend, the artist Jean Alaux.[2] It closely replicates the initial composition of the 1814 version: In the background at the left stands a guard; an unidentified figure is exiting at the right. This version was displayed in the 2014 exhibition L'invention du Passé. Histoires de cœur et d'épée 1802–1850 at the musée des beaux-arts de Lyon.

In the third painting (1820; acquired for the Louvre Abu Dhabi in 2009),[5] Ingres moved the row of caryatids from the left edge of the composition to the center, and reversed the angle of the perspective.[2] The figures of the Duc d'Epernon and Gabrielle d'Estrées are once again in the background at the left. The painting was previously in a private collection in Oslo.[6]

The fourth version (1832; acquired by the Louvre Museum in 1981)[7] is slightly smaller than the others. The setting is changed from the Salle des Caryatides to the Stairway of Henri II, and the number of onlookers is augmented by the inclusion of the poet François de Malherbe, Cardinal Jacques Davy Duperron, and an unidentified man.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3225661,"Pastoral Pleasure (French - Le Plaisir pastoral) is a c. 1714–1716 fête galante painting by Antoine Watteau, now in the Musée Condé in Chantilly.[1][2] Two other Watteau paintings survive with extremely similar compositions - the largest and most finished is The Shepherds, now in the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin; another painting of that composition, once owned by Georges Wildenstein, seems to be a reworking of the Charlottenburg painting. Pierre Rosenberg argues that the Chantilly painting was an oil sketch for the Charlottenburg one. Three other copies of the Chantilly version appeared in 19th and 20th century auctions, but their locations are now unknown.[3]

The Chantilly work belonged to Pierre-Jean Mariette, a great Watteau collector – it is mentioned as being in his possession from at least 1729, around which time Nicolas-Henri Tardieu made an engraving after it. On 1 February 1775 it was sold after Mariette's death. According to Edmond de Goncourt, it was resold in Paris on 11 May 1789, entering the marquis de Maison's collection, which was acquired in its entirety by the duc d'Aumale in 1868 whilst in exile in the United Kingdom. After moving back to France he hung the work in his château de Chantilly, where it still hangs in the Musée Condé.[3]

It shows French aristocrats dressed as shepherds – one couple dances to the right and a young couple court each other on a balcony to the left. The painting also includes real peasants in simpler clothes and with simpler gestures, making it easier to distinguish between them and the aristocrats than in other Watteau paintings such as The Shepherds. Several details are directly inspired by Peter Paul Rubens's paintings: the musician, the man next to him, the shepherd embracing the woman next to him and the dog in the foreground.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3139726,"Homage to Cézanne (French: Hommage à Cézanne) is a painting in oil on canvas by the French artist Maurice Denis dating from 1900.[1] It depicts a number of key figures from the once secret brotherhood[2] of Les Nabis (Hebr. the Prophets). The painting is a retrospective; by 1900 the group was breaking up as its members matured.

In this painting, Maurice Denis has gathered a group of friends, artists and critics to celebrate Paul Cézanne, who is represented by his still life Fruit Bowl, Glass and Apples of 1879–80 on an easel in the centre of the painting.[1] The scene is the shop of the art dealer Ambroise Vollard in the Rue Laffitte.[3] The Cézanne painting had belonged to Paul Gauguin who is thus evoked, despite not being pictured, having left France permanently in 1895 for the South Seas.[1][3][4] Gauguin described the Cézanne as ""an exceptional pearl, the apple of my eye.""[5] Works by Gauguin and Renoir can be seen in the background.[1]

Pictured are many of the key figures from the secret brotherhood of the Nabis, for whom Gauguin was the principal mentor.[6][7] Included are the symbolist painter Odilon Redon, the focus of attention on the far left, Paul Sérusier (Nabi instigator) centre talking to Redon, and at the back, left to right, Édouard Vuillard, the critic André Mellerio wearing a top hat, Ambroise Vollard behind the easel, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Pierre Bonnard with a pipe, and on the far right Marthe Denis, Maurice's wife.[1]

In some ways different from the others, Redon is the group's revered senior figure. Sérusier appears to be explaining to Redon why the Nabis like Cézanne based on his posture.[3] Over time, Redon had come to be more closely associated with Cézanne than with Symbolist fellow traveller Gustave Moreau.[8] Redon's inclusion in the picture is not surprising; Denis was a fan of Redon and once remarked ""the lesson of Redon is his powerlessness to paint anything which is not representative of a state of soul, which does not express some depth of emotion, which does not translate an interior vision.""[9]

The picture is almost life size at 180 cm high and 240 cm broad, which enhances its impact. The composition has strong verticals in the erect poses of the subjects, the easel and the walking stick, against which the brightly coloured rectangle of the framed still life is contrasted.[3] The scene is crowded. Vollard is grasping the easel which is bursting out of the top edge of the painting, and the figures fully occupy the space of the canvas, leaving little room for anything else. Mrs Denis is reduced to peering over Bonnard's shoulder. Contrasting the strong verticals, the heads of the group provide a horizontal rhythm to the work. The conservative black suits belie the avant-garde reputation of the Nabis.[3]

Belinda Thomson described Homage to Cézanne as Denis ""turning away from the more spectacular, subjective Symbolism of Gauguin and van Gogh towards what he saw as the reassertion of classical values in Cézanne.""[10] Denis had visited Rome with Gide in 1898 where he had discovered a renewed interest in classicism.[10] He subsequently published articles such as ""Cézanne"" in 1907 and ""De Gauguin et de Van Gogh au classicisme"" in 1909 which argued that classicism was at the core of French cultural tradition.  By doing so, he influenced a new generation of French artists.[10]

A possible antecedent for the work is A Studio at Les Batignolles (1870) by Henri Fantin-Latour, which features, amongst others, Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Émile Zola and Claude Monet.[3]

Homage to Cézanne was shown at the Salon de la Société nationale des beaux-arts, Paris, 1901, and the Salon de la Libre Esthétique, Brussels, Belgium, 1901.  It was not shown again in an exhibition until 1948.[11]  Reactions in 1901 were mixed. Denis referred to the work in his diary as ""that painting, which still makes the public laugh"".[12]

Homage to Cézanne was in the collection of the writer André Gide who donated it to the Musée du Luxembourg in 1928. It then entered three other collections in Paris: the Musée National d'Art Moderne, in 1977, then The Louvre and finally the Musée d'Orsay. A preparatory drawing is held in a private collection in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.[11]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q32496,"Bathsheba at Her Bath (or Bathsheba with King David's Letter) is an oil painting by the Dutch artist Rembrandt (1606–1669) finished in 1654.

A depiction that is both sensual and empathetic, it shows a moment from the Old Testament story related in 2 Samuel 11 in which King David sees Bathsheba bathing and, entranced, impregnates her.[1] In order to marry Bathsheba and conceal his sin, David sends her husband into battle and orders his generals to abandon him, leaving him to certain death.

While the scene of David spying on Bathsheba had been painted by earlier artists, Rembrandt's depiction differs in its tight pictorial focus and erotic vitality, achieved through broad, thick brushstrokes and vibrant coloration.

The painting hangs in The Louvre; it is one of 583 works donated by Dr. Louis La Caze in 1869.[2] For Kenneth Clark, the canvas is ""Rembrandt's greatest painting of the nude"".[3] Its insight into Bathsheba's moral dilemma has been described as ""one of the great achievements of western painting.""[4]

The Second Book of Samuel (11:2-4) gives the account of King David who saw a woman bathing from his palace roof. When he asked after her, he was told that she was Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David had his messengers retrieve her, and after they slept together she became pregnant with his child. David was able to marry Bathsheba by sending Uriah into battle where he was killed.[1]

Prior to Bathsheba at Her Bath, the standard treatment had been to show Bathsheba bathing out of doors—thus accounting for her visibility to David—and accompanied by maidservants. A tower could usually be seen in the distance, and perhaps a small figure of David, sometimes accompanied by his two courtiers. Such was the design Rembrandt's earlier The Toilet of Bathsheba, dated 1643.[1] By eliminating David, his messengers and most of the traditional narrative elements from the picture—the only anecdotal references included are the letter from David (not actually mentioned in Samuel) and the presence of an attendant drying her foot—Rembrandt's presentation of Bathsheba is both intimate and monumental.[1] As a result, the moralistic theme of previous treatments of the subject is replaced by a direct eroticism in which the viewer supplants David as voyeur.[5]

The work is painted as life sized and in a shallow space, with Bathsheba dominating the composition as she had in no other earlier version of the scene.[6] It is not known whether Rembrandt painted Bathsheba for his own reasons, or to satisfy a commission.[1] Presumably in response to Rembrandt's painting, his ex-pupil and close associate Willem Drost painted Bathsheba with David's Letter the same year, which is also in the Louvre.

Apart from the lack of anecdotal devices, the painting is unusual in other ways. Bathsheba is presented in a space that is difficult to read. The dark background is suggestive of night, while a massive column implies a large architectural structure.[1] Behind her lies a passage of richly painted drapery composed of browns and ochers that impart a golden warmth. Around her rests a thickly painted background of white chemise; set against this her naked flesh stands out for its solid form and the sumptuous application of paint.[6][7] The paint used to describe her figure is richly nuanced, its broad brushstrokes and strong highlights impart a vibrant tactile quality to the body, rendering her presence palpable.[8]

Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs familiar to Rembrandt through engravings.[3][9] A print by Tobias Stimmer may have been influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze.[10] It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654.[11] Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify the impact of the figure.[12] X-radiographs show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie.[13] Initially she appeared to be looking out of the corner of her eye, as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, in the general direction of her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception,[12] and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.[11]

Despite its classical references, the characterization of the figure is unconventional, and the depictions of her large stomach, hands and feet are derived from observation rather than respect for the idealised form.[14] Alternatively, art historian Eric Jan Sluijter proposed that the figure could not have been painted directly from a posed model, given the anatomical discrepancies (an impossibly twisted left arm, the length of the right arm, an unnatural twist of the torso, and the elongated distance from breast to groin) and inconsistencies in perspective that indicate different parts of the figure are viewed from various vantage points.[15] Yet, the figure appears to repose naturally, without tension or movement.[16] Whatever physical awkwardness the figure may possess when compared to classical sources, the truthfulness of her image has been seen as extraordinarily noble; according to Clark, ""this Christian acceptance of the unfortunate body has permitted the Christian privilege of a soul"".[17]

The letter shown in her right hand contains a demand from David for her to choose between fidelity to her husband or obedience to her king, and is an anecdotal catalyst for her introspection.[13][18] In representing this moment, Rembrandt extrapolated from the biblical text, which treated Bathsheba incidentally while focusing on David's sinfulness.[13] As a result, her expression is profound enough to suggest not only her sense of resignation, but the broader narrative as well.[17] As a conception of the nude figure suffused with complexity of thought, Bathsheba at Her Bath is nearly unique in art.[17][19]

The traditionally accepted identification of the model is of Rembrandt's partner Hendrickje Stoffels, who would have been 28 at the time of the painting. Sluijter has proposed otherwise, stating that the likeness is of an ideal type used by Rembrandt over a long period.[20] Assuming Stoffels as the model, medical researchers have observed deformity in the left breast, and have offered various hypotheses including breast cancer, abscess due to tuberculosis and lactation mastitis following an unsuccessful pregnancy.[21] The diagnosis of breast cancer is unlikely, given that Stoffels lived for another nine years.[22]

In ""The medical enigma of Rembrandt's Bathsheba"" Paolo Zamboni professor of Vascular Surgery University of Ferrara, solves the mystery of the model's breast.  According to Zamboni the model was effected by thrombophlebitis of a superficial vein of the breast, a condition described by Mondor in 1939. So not mastitis or carcinoma, as believed for centuries. This diagnosis became real thanks to the analysis of a Zamboni patient's right breast after confirmed by an ultrasound check. As proof, mammography was negative for both cancer and mastitis, confirming the validity of the diagnosis on canvas proposed by Paolo Zamboni. [23] [24][25][26]

The look of sorrow in the subject's face has been interpreted as evidence of Stoffels' illness and pregnancy (she gave birth to a daughter in October 1654),[27] Rembrandt's difficulties with the Church stemming from his cohabitation with Stoffels, and the artist's impending bankruptcy.[21] An alternative hypothesis for the model's identity has suggested that Stoffels' head was placed on the body of another model,[22] which is consistent with the result derived from x-rays that Bathsheba's head had been repainted.

Allusions to Bathsheba at Her Bath have been noted in the works of 19th- and 20th-century artists. It is thought to have inspired The Surprised Nymph (1859–61), an early figure by Édouard Manet that playfully references old master sources.[29] Edgar Degas' pastel Woman Having Her Hair Combed (c. 1885) has been compared to Bathsheba for similarities in the model's attitude;[28] Degas' father was an acquaintance of Louis La Caze, who owned Bathsheba prior to bequeathing it to the Louvre in 1869.[30][31]

Frédéric Bazille recalled Bathsheba in his La Toilette, painted for the 1870 Paris Salon. Similar in size and format, Bazille's work shares some of the mood of the Rembrandt: according to critic Dianne Pitman, ""not the unfolding of a specific narrative but the interplay of sensual effect and solemnity, blending realistic intimacy and dignified remoteness"".[32] A 1963 print by Picasso, Seated Nude and Another Figure, refers to the overtly voyeuristic properties of Bathsheba.[33]

The painting and its attempted theft forms the subject of ""This One Goes to Eleven"", a third-season episode of the Canadian television detective series Murdoch Mysteries.

The painting was depicted in the film Entrapment, where it was stolen by art thief Virginia ""Gin"" Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones), but stolen from her by another art thief Robert ""Mac"" MacDougal (Sean Connery).

The Avanton Cone was the second such object to be discovered (after the Golden Hat of Schifferstadt). It was found in 1844 in a field near the village of Avanton, about 12 kilometres (7 mi) north of Poitiers, France. The object was damaged; comparison with other finds suggests that a part (the brim) is missing. The remaining part of the Avanton cone is 55-centimetre (22 in) long and weighs 285 grams (10 oz). Originally dated to the Middle Bronze and suggested to be a fertility symbol, it now appears to be of later date and more complex function (see Golden hats).

The Avanton Cone is on display in the Musée d'Archéologie Nationale at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3498655,"Venus Anadyomene is a painting by the French painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It is now held at the Musée Condé, Chantilly, France. It is a female nude of the Venus Anadyomene type, showing the goddess Venus rising from the sea.

Ingres began the painting in 1808 during his stay in Rome at the French Academy. The first preparatory drawings showed Venus in the Venus Pudica position, standing and covering her breasts with her hands.[1] The pose was inspired by Botticelli's The Birth of Venus – Ingres visited Florence and the Uffizi in 1805 and could have seen the painting there. A drawing of 1806 then shows the goddess with her arms in the air and her hair in her hands, a pose the artist also used in his 1856 The Source.

The painting remained in the planning stages until 1848, when he completed it as a commission from the banker and botanist Benjamin Delessert. This involved major changes to the colour scheme Ingres had originally planned for the painting. However, in the end Delessert declined the painting since he felt the knee was drawn awkwardly. Later in 1848 the painting was sold to Frédéric Reiset, curator of drawings at the Louvre Museum. It was exhibited at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where it was seen by the poet Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire argued that the head was inspired by classical sculpture, the hands by Raphael, and the narrow torso by medieval sculpture.[a]

In 1879 this painting and the rest of the Reiset collection were bought by Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale.[2] It was closely followed by later treatments of the subject, such as Théodore Chassériau's Vénus marine and Bouguereau's 1879 The Birth of Venus. A smaller copy of the painting from c.1825–1850 is in the Louvre[3] and the preparatory drawings are now in the Ingres Museum in Montauban.[4][5][6]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1131476,"The Deposition of Christ is a painting by the Italian artist Agnolo di Cosimo, known as Bronzino, completed in 1545. It is housed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Besançon, France.[1] A copy by Bronzino can be found in the Palazzo Vecchio. This portrayal of the Deposition, although it depicts all the characters typically shown when Jesus is being taken down from the cross, more correctly should be characterized as a Lamentation[2] and is an excellent example of late Mannerism or Maniera.

The painting was originally commissioned to be the altarpiece for the chapel of Eleonora of Toledo in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Shortly after it was completed in 1545, Eleonora's husband, Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, shipped the picture to Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle, a chief counselor of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as a diplomatic gift. Granvelle installed it in his private chapel in Besançon.[3][4] In 1549, Granvelle commissioned the construction of a grander funerary chapel on his Besançon estate. A year later, he died. The new chapel, with Bronzino's altarpiece installed, was consecrated in 1551. Subsequently, there is no record of the work from the seventeenth century until the French Revolution. To preserve it after Granvelle's chapel was partially destroyed, the picture was housed in the Besançon city hall from 1793 until it became a part of the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts when the museum opened in 1834.[5]

After sending the original to Granvelle in 1545, Cosimo requested a copy for Eleonora's chapel that Bronzino painted eight years later in 1553. The second version is the one found in the Palazzo Vecchio today.[3][6]

To accompany the original altarpiece, Bronzino painted side panels depicting John the Baptist (the patron saint of Florence) on the left and Saint Cosmas (a patron saint of the Medici family and Cosimo's name-saint) on the right. Their inclusion in Eleonora's chapel was as much a political statement as a religious one and these panels may have been portraits of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere (Cosimo's father) as John the Baptist and Cosimo as Saint Cosmas.[7] At some point between 1545 and 1553, Eleonora requested that Bronzino replace the side panels of the saints with more pious panels depicting the Annunciation.[8] This must have been a low priority because the new altar wings were not completed until 1564, two years after Eleonora's death.[9] The Annunciation panels can be viewed in Eleonora's chapel today.

By 1553, the side panels of the saints were in storage. They were last recorded as being in the Medici inventory in 1609 and both were considered lost until the John the Baptist panel resurfaced in 1951. It is now housed in the Getty Center.[10] A fragment purportedly of the Saint Cosmas panel has recently been rediscovered, but it is suspected to be a forgery associated with art dealer Giulano Ruffini.[11][12]

In the center foreground is a Pietà portraying the body of Jesus being cradled in his mother Mary's arms. The Apostle John supports his back and is modeled on a youth holding up the body of Christ in a Deposition painted by Bronzino's teacher, Pontormo.[13] Mary Magdalene kneels on the right and supports the feet of Jesus. Her jar of ointment is shown in the far right foreground.[14]

Four holy women mourn on the left and another dressed in green peers over the Virgin's shoulder and stands out prominently because of her hand gesture and location in the center of the panel. Scholars believe this highlighted woman is one of the three Marys, Mary of Clopas.[2][15] Two of the three men in the background are named in the Gospel of John as the followers who took Jesus down from the cross and prepared his body for burial. Nicodemus is depicted on the left holding a large ewer filled with embalming spices. On the right, Joseph of Arimathea holds the nails of the Crucifixion as well as the pincers used to remove them. The man between them is an unnamed companion.[16]

In addition to the nails held by Joseph, other Arma Christi (instruments of the Passion) are presented throughout the painting. The angels floating above the scene hold the column where Jesus was whipped, the sponge, the lance, and the cross. The crown of thorns is lying in the dirt at John's feet.[17]

The principal figures are attended by two angels, one bearing a chalice and the other lifting a transparent veil. Both of these objects are symbols of the Eucharist. The viewer can best appreciate the sacramental nature of the work by considering its original setting. The two angels are gazing out of the panel towards the sides. In Eleonora's chapel, they would appear to be looking at the frescoes of the story of Moses on the adjacent walls. In particular, the angel on the left would be gazing at a fresco of Moses Striking the Rock and the Gathering of the Manna. The manna and the water pouring from the rock presage the bread and wine used in the Eucharist.[18]


Bronzino's second version, in general, is an accurate copy of the first. The most obvious deviation is the darker, more subdued color. Much of the brilliant blue has been substituted with a drab brown. Toning down the Mannerist lavishness of the original is consistent with the sobriety of the Counter-Reformation and may reflect Eleonora's sensibilities.[2]
In addition to embedding donor portraits and likenesses of themselves in their works, sixteenth-century Florentine artists were known to portray other artisans and associates in their paintings and sculptures.[19] Since neither Bronzino nor his Medici employers documented the existence of embedded portraits in this work, art historians have postulated a number possibilities based on comparisons with other known portraits. Janet Cox-Rearick suggested that the central figure of Mary of Clopas was an idealized portrait of Eleonora herself[15] and that the Virgin Mother was a representation of Cosimo's mother, Maria Salviati.[20] She also proposed that Nicodemus, the unnamed companion, and Joseph of Arimathea were, respectively, portraits of Bronzino (the artist), Pontormo (his teacher), and Baccio Bandinelli (a rival artist who had submitted a modello for the altarpiece).[21] Elizabeth Pilliod has an alternative suggestion: the three companions from left to right are portraits of Giovambattista del Tasso (the architect who created Eleonora's chapel), Francesco di Ser Jacopo (a financial administrator for Cosimo), and Niccolò Tribolo (another artist in the service of the Medici).[19]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2843410,"The Arrival of Marie de Medici at Marseilles is a Baroque painting done by Sir Peter Paul Rubens c. 1622-1625. It was commissioned by Marie de' Medici of France to commemorate the life of her and her husband Henry IV of France. This painting was one of the 24 paintings in the Marie de' Medici cycle by Rubens.[1]    The painting currently resides in the Louvre in Paris. [2]

Marie de Medici commissioned 24 paintings, pictures that depicted historical events in her life, with the intention to decorate the Palais du Luxembourg. She commissioned the paintings in an attempt to sway public opinion regarding her right to rule. Due to her foreign heritage, the French saw her as undeserving of her position as a ruler. After her arrival, she married Henry IV in 1600. He would die ten years later, well before the cycle was commissioned.[3]

The Arrival of Marie de’ Medici at Marseilles shows the Queen of France arriving by ship in Marseille on November 3, 1600. She is greeted by unknown characters that represent France, as they are seen with the French royalty symbol, the Fleur-de-lis. At the bottom of the painting, Neptune and the daughters of Nereus, the Sea God, are seen saluting the Queen. At the top of the painting, the character Fame is flying overhead, trumpeting the Queen’s arrival. Rubens uses these symbolic figures to transform a historical event into an allegory that reinforces Marie de' Medici's right to the throne. The various French symbols depicted greeting Marie upon her arrival are meant to establish good will and respect between her and the French people.[4]

The small work is thought to have been painted between 1862 and 1865. It was presented to the Strasbourg museum by the Société des amis des musées de la ville de Strasbourg (today called the Société des amis des arts et des musées de Strasbourg, or SAAMS)[2] in 1924 and is now in the Musée d'Art moderne et contemporain. Its inventory number is 55.974.0.684.[3]

La Petite Fabrique marks a transition in Pissarro's work, away from Neoclassical landscape depictions à la Camille Corot and towards Realism with underlying social motives. In spite of its peacefulness and nonthreatening size, the little factory announces the inexorable transformation (i. e. industrialisation) of the countryside.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q38403891,"Visitation is a 1610s oil painting by the Flemish Baroque artist Peter Paul Rubens. It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 198.[2]

The painting was bought in London in 1890. It was first recorded as belonging to the estate of John Douglas of Gyrn Castle in 1840. Its previous history has been hypothetically reconstructed back until 1758, when it was supposedly sold with the collection of a Martin Robyns, on 22 May of that year.[1][3]

Visitation is a modello, and it has long been assumed that it has been painted as a first idea for the left wing of the Antwerp cathedral triptych The Descent from the Cross, one of Rubens's most famous and influential works, and then abandoned, since the actual modello for the actual Antwerp Visitation is a version now kept in the Courtauld Institute of Art.[2][4] In 2005 however, the Spanish art historian Matías Díaz Padrón, longtime director of the department of Flemish and Dutch paintings of the Museo del Prado, demonstrated that the Strasbourg modello had in fact been used for another triptych (held in a private collection) of slightly later date and much smaller dimensions than the Antwerp one. Accordingly, the generally admitted date of 1611–1612 may in fact be corrected to 1614–1615. While broadly agreeing with Díaz Padrón, his French counterpart from the Louvre, Jacques Foucart, thinks that the privately held triptych is in fact not the original from Rubens's hand, but an early and very good copy of  a lost Rubens original.[1][2]

As with many Rubens works of that period, the Strasbourg painting shows influences of Annibale Carracci and Paolo Veronese. A study for the painting (ink on paper, 26.5 cm (10.4 in) x 36 cm (14 in)) is kept in Bayonne's Musée Bonnat.[1][2]

It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 364.[1][2]The painting was bought from Charles Sedelmeyer in 1895 by the director of the Strasbourg museum, Wilhelm von Bode, and entered the collections two years later. As of 2014, it was the only Dutch painting of that kind (schuttersstuk; English: ""militia piece"") in a French museum.[3]

The painting depicts a banquet of 46 men in arms from the voluntary civic guard of Haarlem. The scene takes place in the civic guard meeting hall, and that is where the painting probably used to hang until the 18th century. One of these faces is supposed to be a self-portrait of Engelsz. Due to its size – The St Adrian Civic Guard is by far the largest Old Master painting in the Strasbourg collection – the painting could not be evacuated during World War II and was severely damaged when Palais Rohan was hit during an Anglo-American bombing raid on 11 August 1944. Poor post-war restoration work made the damage even worse, and Engelsz.' painting disappeared from sight until late 2008, when a partnership was launched between the museum and BNP Paribas in order to restore it for good. After five years of work, the restored painting was then revealed to the public in early 2014.[4][1][3]

The style of the painting is inspired by Cornelis van Haarlem and does seem archaic next to Frans Hals's The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616, which revolutionized the genre by its liveliness and dynamism. Following that example, Engelsz.' next schuttersstuk, The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1618 (in the collection of the Frans Hals Museum),[5] would then look nothing like the Strasbourg painting.[1]

The Forge at Marly-le-Roi is an oil on canvas painting by British-born French artist Alfred Sisley, created in 1875. It was part of the François Depeaux collection until its sale in 1906 by the Galerie Georges Petit to Étienne Moreau-Nélaton. Moreau-Nélaton left it to the French state later in 1906 and it has been displayed at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris, since 1986.[1]

The painting was painted at the bottom of the Grande Rue de Marly-le-Roi, adjoining the Hôtel de Toulouse, at number 48, where there was a forge, nowadays transformed into a garage.

Sisley was mainly a landscape painter, like fellow Impressionist Claude Monet, so an intimate canvas by him dedicated to on human activities is rare.[2] Among his around of 800 listed canvases, French Art historian Sylvie Patin counts only three interior views, The Lesson (1871), The Interior of a Farm in Moret (1880), and this one, which testifies the interest of the artist for simple people while living in Marly-le-Roi.[3]

The lighting of the scene comes from the window, some panes of which are closed, and from the glowing forge. For the art historian Jean-Jacques Lévêque, ""the treatment of chiaroscuro is exceptional in the work of an artist so lost in light, and so adept at capturing it"".[4]

Charles Sterling argues the work was produced in the painter's youth, but Pierre Rosenberg argues it was produced at the end of his career around 1650.

The painting figures prominently in Muriel Spark’s novella The Only Problem, wherein the protagonist Harvey Gotham, an amateur scholar of the Book of Job, struggles to reconcile the painting’s kindly portrayal of Job’s wife with the harsh words she speaks in Job.

Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation is a 1480s painting by the German-born citizen of Bruges, Hans Memling. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 185.[2]

The work consists of six isolated panels which had originally been arranged recto-verso as pairs and were sawn apart at some point before 1890. Neither the order of the panels from left to right, nor the coupling of the pairs of paintings, is known with certainty; and because of the work's theological content, it is disputed if it was designed as a triptych or as a polyptych. Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation has generally risen and still raises more questions among art historians than almost any other work of its century, or any century.[1]
As it exists now, Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation consists of a narrative sequence (Vanity is followed by Death, which is followed either by Hell or by the Redemption through Jesus; this is framed by a general memento mori and a particular coat of arms). But this sequence may well be incomplete or not entirely reflect the intended purpose: for instance, Vanity may also be a depiction of Luxuria, etc.

The attribution of the work has been disputed. In 1890, Wilhelm von Bode bought it in Florence, Italy, as a Memling, but as early as 1892, he attributed it to Memling's contemporary, Simon Marmion. This attribution was kept by some specialists, while several others – such as Hugo von Tschudi, Georges Hulin de Loo, and Max J. Friedlander – maintained that it was indeed a Memling; of the late period and of very high quality as far as Friedlander was concerned. The debate later shifted on the question of authenticity: it was questioned if it was a painting by Memling himself, or rather by an assistant, a follower, or an imitator. The question has been settled since 1994, when thorough examination showed that it was indeed a genuine work by Hans Memling himself.[1]

The destination of the work has been just as disputed. The coat of arms had been attributed to several Italian families, until Hulin de Loo identified it as the Loiani family crest. The work may have been commissioned by Giovanni d′Antonio Loiano, from Bologna, who had married a Flemish woman. It remains unresolved if the work was as it is now, i.e. a triptych, or if a recto-verso panel has been lost and the work had originally been a polyptych. This hypothesis in turn raises the question of the painterly subjects on either side of the lost panel. Moreover, as it could be closed (as a triptych), or folded (as a polyptych), there is no certainty as to the order in which the paintings were shown in either state. Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation was probably used for private devotion, as a domestic altarpiece that could also be carried with its owner.[1][2]

The iconographic program of Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation is complex, although not impenetrably so, hence the title given to the work. The proponents of the theory that a fourth recto-verso panel is missing suggest that it could have shown the Virgin Mary (responding to her son depicted as a Salvator Mundi but also with attributes of a Christ in Majesty, such as the crown) on one side, and Adam on the other (responding to Eve, depicted as the allegorical figure of Vanity). The purposes of Death, Hell, Memento mori, and the coat of arms, are quite clear, although their position is not. Vanity (which may also represent Luxuria) and Death share aesthetic and thematic parallels, not least in the very prominent genital area, a fact that has prompted the tenants of the triptych hypothesis to dismiss the idea that Vanity/Luxuria should have been paired with another painting instead. On the other hand, the probable pairing of Christ with Hell is theologically untenable; as in Memling’s own Last Judgment, depictions of Hell are generally paired with depictions of Heaven.[1]

Satan's face on the belly (Bauchgesicht [de]) has been noticed by art historians,[3] as has Vanity's/Luxuria's eroticism.[4][5]

The following pairings have been suggested as being the most plausible:[1]

As a triptych:

As a polyptych:

In both cases, only Vanity and Death appear together on the same side, while Hell and Christ, and Hell and Death, and even Memento mori and Coat of arms appear once on the same side, and once on opposite sides.

Vanity, or Luxuria

Death. The text says: Ecce finis hominis comparatus sum luto et assimilatus sum faville et cineri (""This is the end of Man; I am like mud [or clay] and I return to dust and ashes"")

Christ in Majesty/Salvator Mundi

Coat of arms. The text says: Nul bien sans peine (""No good without effort"" or ""No pain, no gain"")

Memento mori. The text says: Scio enim quod redemptor meus vivit et in novissimo diedeterra surrecturus sum et rursum circūdabor pelle mea et incarne mea videbo deū salvaorem meum Job XIX° cap° (""For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God"", Book of Job 19, 25-26 (KJV))

Hell. The text says: In inferno, nulla est redemptio (""There is no redemption in Hell"")

The Hell panel was used as the cover art for Bruce Dickinson's 2005 metal album Tyranny of Souls.

A  Piorko's MA thesis contains some small errata. It references the 2009 book Collection du musée des Beaux-Arts – Peinture flamande et hollandaise XVème-XVIIIème siècle but erroneously quotes pages 49–53 instead of 51–55. It also consistently misspells memento mori as ""momento mori"".

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5287337,"Dr. Gachet's Garden in Auvers and Marguerite Gachet in the Garden were both painted in 1890 by Vincent van Gogh in the gardens of his homeopathic physician, Dr. Paul Gachet. Both paintings reside at the Musée d'Orsay.

Following a year's stay at an asylum in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh left the hospital in May 1890 for Paris[1] where he had a three-day stay with his brother, Theo, Theo's wife Johanna and their new baby Vincent.  From there he went to Auvers-sur-Oise.[2]  Van Gogh left Saint-Rémy to come to Auvers to be near his brother, but away from the bustle of the city.[1]

While Van Gogh was in Saint-Rémy, his brother, Theo and artist Camille Pissarro developed a plan for Van Gogh to go to Auvers-sur-Oise with a letter of introduction for Dr. Paul Gachet[1] a homeopathic physician and art patron who lived in Auvers.[3][4] The plan also included him staying at a nearby inn while under the doctor's care. Van Gogh had a room at the nearby Auberge Ravoux.[2]

Van Gogh developed a close relationship with the doctor who he described as ""something like another brother.""[2] From the first meeting, though, Van Gogh sensed that Dr. Gachet may have been as ill as he. In a letter from May 20, 1890, Van Gogh wrote, ""I have seen Dr. Gachet, who made the impression on me of being rather eccentric, but his experience as a doctor must keep him balanced while fighting the nervous trouble from which he certainly seems to me to be suffering at least as seriously as I.""[5]

Van Gogh derived enjoyment from gardens; from his father's garden in the Netherlands, the garden he created at his London rental property when he was an art dealer there, to the many paintings that he made of flowers and other gardens. When he integrated Impressionism into his work, his interest in gardens are depicted in the gardens of the Arles hospital, Saint-Rémy asylum and the gardens of Charles Daubigny and Dr. Paul Gachet in Auvers.[6]

Van Gogh wrote many letters to his brother Theo and Willemina about gardening ideas, color harmonies and the benefits of working in a garden.  Known for his works of sunflowers, he also made paintings with red poppies, grasses, irises and other garden plants. The colors used in the paintings may have been suggestive of his mood. When depressed, he painted ""ghostly white-hooded arums."" When he was in good mood he used bright colors, such as vibrant pink oleanders. During times of inner turmoil, “dark green spire like cypresses writhing with energy and contorted olive trees vibrant with silvery leaves.[6]

To his sister, Wil, Van Gogh advised her to cultivate her own garden, like Voltaire's Candide, to find joy and meaning in life.[7]

Sue Roe, author of The Private Lives of the Impressionists, wrote of Dr. Gachet's garden:

""Dr. Gachet's house was set in the hillside above the main street [of the village], with a terraced garden full of flowers and looking down into the valley of the Oise.  The house and garden were always full of stray cats, chickens and a ragged, featherless rooster... In the garden, he [Dr. Gachet] worked at a table painted bright orange (later immortalized by Van Gogh, in his Portrait of Dr Gachet).""[8]
""Maison du Dr. Gachet,"" the house and gardens of Dr. Paul Gachet, was opened to the public in 2004.[9]

Van Gogh became friends with Gachet very quickly after arriving at Auvers.  He was invited to visit his home as he wanted.  Van Gogh hoped to paint Gachet's garden, possibly one or two days a week.[10]

In late June Van Gogh wrote of his interest to paint Marguerite Gachet, maybe in a country girl pose.[11] A few days later he wrote that he painted her in a pink dress playing a piano,[12] and the previous day she had posed for this garden painting.[6] In Marguerite Gachet in the Garden, Marguerite is dressed in white, ""like a bride."" The garden of white roses and light lemon marigolds. It was rumored in Auvers that Van Gogh considered Marguerite a friend and that she desired a relationship with him.[6]

Dr. Gachet, though, had not given permission for the sittings and when he learned of the two sittings in two consecutive nights he was quite apprehensive about any relationship they might share.[13] Dr. Gachet asked Van Gogh to end his relationship with Marguerite.[14]

Derek Fell, author of Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness, suggests that Van Gogh may have cared more deeply than imagined and been at least in part the reason for shooting himself. In a letter to Theo Van Gogh expressed his sadness and frustration of not having a long-term partnership, ""That desire [for marriage] has left me, though the mental suffering of it remains.""[15]

There were other concerns as well that affected Van Gogh at that time: the illness of Theo's baby, Theo's health and employment issues, potential loss of Theo's support and the destruction of his relationship with Dr. Gachet who was meant to manage Van Gogh's health and be a stabilizing influence.[1][2]

Both 'garden paintings' were part of the collection of Dr. Gachet until 1954 when they were given to the state and allotted to the Louvre museum, gallery of Jeu de Paume.[16]   The paintings resided there at the gallery of Jeu de Paume,[16] or Musée de l'Impressionisme[17] from 1954 to 1986.[16] In 1986 the museum closed due to cramped conditions and its collections were transferred to the new Musée d’Orsay.[17] Since 1986 the paintings have been at the Musée d'Orsay.[16]

Gachet and his daughter were both subjects for Van Gogh's paintings.[2]

Portrait of Dr. Gachet(2nd version)1890Musée d'Orsay, Paris (F754)

Marguerite Gachet at the Piano1890Kunstmuseum Basel, Basel, Switzerland (F772)

For a time, Van Gogh seemed to improve.  He began to paint at such a steady pace, there was barely space in his room for all the finished paintings.[1] From May until his death on July 29, Van Gogh made about 70 paintings, more than one a day, and many drawings.[3] Van Gogh painted buildings around the town of Auvers, such as The Church at Auvers, portraits, and the nearby fields.[2]

From Wallace,[1] ""But for all his appearance of a renewed well-being his life was very near its end."" Illness struck Theo's baby, Vincent. Theo had both health and employment issues; he considered leaving his employer and starting his own business. Gachet, said to have his own eccentricities and neurosis, caused Van Gogh concern to which he questioned: ""Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both end up in the ditch?""[1][2]

After visiting Paris for a family conference, Van Gogh returned to Auvers more bleak. In a letter he wrote, ""And the prospect grows darker, I see no future at all.""[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99437847,"Saint Anthony of Padua holding the Infant Jesus is a devotional painting by the Italian artist from Genoa, Bernardo Strozzi. It is stylistically dated from his middle period and was made around 1625 in his hometown. The painting was presented to the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France, by the collectors Othon Kaufmann and François Schlageter in 1994. Its inventory number is 44.994.1.7.[2]

According to the 2017 catalogue of the Italian paintings in the MBA Strasbourg, the painting has been overlooked by the most recent monographs about the painter (Luisa Mortari 1995, and Camillo Manzitti 2013), but it had been much admired and influential in the past. Ancient copies are found in the Museo Civico of Asolo, the Museo Civico of Cremona, a private collection in Rome, the church of Santa Maria Formosa in Venice, and the church of San Nicolò da Tolentino in the same city.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1212861,"The Birth of Venus  (French: Naissance de Venus) is a painting by the French artist Alexandre Cabanel. It was painted in 1863, and is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. A second and smaller version (85 x 135.9 cm) from ca. 1864 is in Dahesh Museum of Art.[1] A third (106 x 182.6 cm)[2] version dates from 1875; it is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Shown to great success at the Paris Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was immediately purchased by Napoleon III for his own personal collection.[3] That same year Cabanel was made a professor of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.

Cabanel's combination of sensual and classical imagery appealed to the higher levels of society.[3] Art historian and curator Robert Rosenblum wrote of Cabanel's The Birth of Venus that ""This Venus hovers somewhere between an ancient deity and a modern dream""; he described ""the ambiguity of her eyes, that seem to be closed but that a close look reveals that she is awake ...  A nude who could be asleep or awake is specially formidable for a male viewer.""[4]

At the Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was one of a multitude of female nudes. Bathed in opalescent colors, the goddess Venus shyly looks to the viewer from beneath the crook of her elbow. Two years later, Manet presented his now renowned painting Olympia at the Salon as well. Today both hang in the Musee’d’ Orsay. Unlike Venus's ethereal-like palette, Manet painted Olympia with pale, placid skin tone, and darkly outlined the figure. Her only seemingly modest gesture is her placement of her hand over her leg, though it is not out of shyness- one must pay before they can see. James Rubin writes of the two works: ""The Olympia is often compared to Cabanel's Birth of Venus, for the latter is a far more sexually appealing work, despite its mythological guise… It is evident Manet's demythologizing of the female nude was foremost a timely reminder of modern realities.""[5][check quotation syntax]

Cabanel depicts personality, but in subtle ways through her relaxed posture and sleepy expression. Jenna-Marie Newberry writes of Venus: ""The lightest of color used in The Birth of Venus alludes to the lightness and enlightenment of relaxation, amplifying the reclining nude's placid demeanor and virginity. The contrapposto twist of the figure with the melodramatic swoop of the arm over the face comes directly from his previous paintings … Venus herself takes over the entire front of the picture plane. Her hair has been deepened, adding more to her allure and purity.""[6] It is as if the viewer is catching a glimpse of a goddess simply basking in the nature that enfolds her. She is a part of her surroundings and the viewer is privy to behold upon the scene.[citation needed] Cabanel produced a quite seductive painting of a mythological beauty in a way that appealed to viewers at the time of its creation. Following the Salon it was said: ""His dark-eyed heroines, thinly painted, usually in muted colors and immaculately drawn, were popular on both sides of the Atlantic"".[7]

Over time, Cabanel developed what would become his signature style. It was his attention to detail that made him popular in the nineteenth century. Cabanel was schooled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts under the painter François-Edouard Picot. Following his tutelage, he entered his first Salon in 1843 and won second place in the Prix de Rome in 1845. ""Several major decorative commissions followed including the ceiling in the Cabinet des Dessins in the Louvre, and are typical of Cabanel's talent for achieving sumptuous effects."" Initially famous for his mythological paintings, Cabanel also made a name for himself in Europe and abroad through his portraits. ""Praised as a portraitist of women, Cabanel expressed that he was particularly adept at painting portraits of American women.""[8]

A portrait by Cabanel was a desirable commodity. He was a favored portraitist of the Emperor Napoleon himself, and he also refused to travel outside France to accept a commission.[citation needed] This required American elite to travel to Paris to sit for him. ""Cabanel had the ability to lend his sitters an air of gentility and urbanity, and to give them an aristocratic allure.""[9]  C.H Stranahan summarized the appeal of Cabanel's style shortly before his death saying: ""…He is especially the master of every grace attractive to woman; great judiciousness in rendering what his subtle reading of the human face gives him; great power and knowledge of hands, which leads to his throwing a veil of mystery over the expression, even leaving a softening vagueness"".[10]

Upon his death in 1889, ""Journals and dailies paid indulgent tribute to Cabanel in obituaries."" In one, he was called ""the most distinguished painter of the grand style,"" and ""all commented on Cabanel's liberal teaching"".[11]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2275653,"The Self-Portrait with a Friend (also known as Double Portrait and as Raphael and His Fencing Master[1]) is a painting by Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael. It dates to 1518–1520,[2] and is in the Louvre Museum of Paris, France.  Whether the figure on the left is actually a self-portrait by Raphael is uncertain,[better source needed] although it was already identified as such in a 16th-century print.[3]

The identity of the man portrayed before Raphael is unknown. Traditionally he was identified as his fencing master, since he holds the hilt of a sword.[4] Modern art historians consider him a close friend,[5] or possibly one of the painter's pupils, perhaps Polidoro da Caravaggio or Giulio Romano.[6][7][8] One possibility is Giovanni Battista Branconio, for whom Raphael had designed, in the Borgo quarter of Rome, the now destroyed Palazzo Branconio. Other people associated with the character include Pietro Aretino, Baldassarre Peruzzi and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, as well as other painters such as Il Pordenone or Pontormo, but these hypotheses have been refuted by other portraits.

A significant portion of the painting seems to have been executed by one of Raphael's pupils.[9]

The painting was owned by Francis I of France and, in the past, was assigned to other artists, including Sebastiano del Piombo.

The Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta is a painting attributed to the Italian Renaissance master Piero della Francesca (c. 1451). It portrays the condottiero and lord of Rimini and Fano Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, and is housed in the Musée du Louvre of Paris.

The portrait depicts the condottiero by profile and, according to some sources, was based on a medal executed in 1445 by Pisanello, or to one by Matteo de' Pasti from 1450. The picture itself is believed to be executed by Piero della Francesca during his sojourn in Rimini, during which he also painted the fresco with Sigismondo Pandolfo kneeling after St. Sigismund in the Tempio Malatestiano (Cathedral) of the city.

Despite the choice of the profile representation, typical of the portraits of eminent figures of the type, Piero della Francesca showed his attention for naturalist details in the fine execution of the texture and the hair of the committent. This is a proof of his good knowledge of Flemish masters such as Rogier van der Weyden.

Attribution is not certain and very late. Until 1889, it used to belong to the Russian Imperial Art Collection. Only as art piece of the d'Ancona collection in Milan in late 19th century, it was first attributed to Piero della Francesca by art-dealer Giovanni Morelli. From there it moved to Contini-Bonacossi collection, where Roberto Longhi reiterated the attribution before the family sold it to the Louvre. However, doubts were raised by Italian art critics and professors, some of whom believed it to be a neoclassical fake due to its uncanny resemblance with the painting of Tempio Malatestiano. Similarly, an Italian ministerial art commission refused to buy it in 1969 as part of the Contini-Bonacossi bequest due to the doubts surrounding its attribution. French art historians have, instead, always been unanimous on its attribution, especially after entering the Louvre collection.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3556817,"Diana Bathing or Diana Getting out of her Bath (French: Diane sortant du bain) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist François Boucher, created in 1742. It depicts the Roman goddess Diana, with a nymph as her companion. The painting was acquired in 1852 by the Louvre, in Paris.[1]

The painting depicts in the foreground, the naked goddess Diana, having just coming out from her bath, with a female companion. Diana is recognizable by the crown of pearls that she wears, with a crescent-shaped jewel, and is in the company of a nymph kneeling at her feet.

The goddess is nude, sitting on silks that enhance her fair complexion and blonde hair; the nymph, to her right, and left of the canvas, has dark hair, and observes the legs of the goddess. The bright skin tones acquire reddish reflections, in contrast to the bluish green of the landscape. 

The fact that the naked woman represented is the goddess of hunting is evidenced by her attributes, such as the quiver with the arrows, the two hunting dogs, and some prey. Diana sits on a silk fabric that symbolizes luxury and contrasts with the rural hinterland. Among the hunted animals there are two doves – symbols of love – which were often an attribute of Venice. Boucher used a similar motif in his work representing Venus Consoling Love. On the left there are two dogs, one drinks water from the pond where the goddess has just emerged, while the other turns his head.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5419125,"Ex-Voto de 1662 is a painting by the French artist Philippe de Champaigne now in the Louvre in Paris. One of Champaigne's most accomplished works, it is a votive offering (an ex-voto) by the painter which depicts a miracle involving his daughter that is said to have occurred at the Port-Royal-des-Champs Cistercian convent.

A ray of light illuminates Mother-Superior Agnès Arnauld, who experienced on the ninth day of her novena for Champaigne's daughter, Sister Catherine de Sainte Suzanne, the hope that a cure would come for Sister Catherine. Catherine (seated, praying) was the painter's only surviving child, and had been suffering from a paralyzing illness. Until that point, prayer and medical treatments (""potions, baths, unctions, and thirty bleedings"") had proven futile. After the Mother-Superior's novena, Sister Catherine soon attempted to walk, and found herself increasingly mobile; the illness no longer seemed present. The painting is a statement of gratitude by the father for the cure of his daughter. The miracle it portrays also symbolized hope for the cause of the Jansenists, who were subject to persecution by ecclesiastical and civil authorities. The Jansenists followed Cornelius Jansen, who reasserted the theology of St. Augustine, and were in conflict with the Jesuits. Their refusal to sign a document condemning five propositions found in Jansen's Augustinus resulted in their being deprived of the sacraments and confined to the abbey, which was eventually torn down.

The composition is unique among Champaigne's work, with the two figures having richly defined, ""sculptural"" forms, lending them vitality and setting them off from the restricted hues and ""angular simplicity"" of the setting (Rand 1990). The figures dominate the canvas, giving the painting a monumental quality. The texture, weight, and folds of the robes are modeled in great detail, revealing Champaigne's Flemish training. His decision to portray the moment that Mother-Superior Agnès is instilled with hope, rather than the cure itself, is evident in the fact that the ray of light illuminates her instead of his daughter. The light develops a ""chronological tension"" that suggests ""what will happen as a result of what is happening"" (Rand 1983).

The painting includes a Latin inscription on the wall on the left of the painting. Neither the text nor the lettering were Champaigne's work.

The inscription, addressed to Christ, recounts that Sister Catherine suffered for 14 months from a high fever and that half her body was paralyzed; that she prayed with Mother Agnès and her health was restored, and again she offered herself to Christ; and that Champaigne offers the painting as a testament to this miracle and to express his joy.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q476458,"Oath of the Horatii (French: Le Serment des Horaces), is a large painting by the French artist Jacques-Louis David painted in 1784 and 1785 and now on display in the Louvre in Paris.[1] The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public, and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style.

It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a seventh-century BC dispute between two warring cities, Rome and Alba Longa,[2] and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one's country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city.  From Rome, three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome,[1] are shown stretching their hands towards their father who holds their swords out for them.[3] Of the three Horatii brothers, only one will survive the confrontation. However, it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa: he allows the three fighters to chase him, causing them to separate from each other, and then, in turn, kills each Curiatii brother. Aside from the three brothers depicted, David also represents, in the bottom right corner, a woman crying while sitting down. She is Camilla, a sister of the Horatii brothers, who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters, and thus she weeps in the realisation that, whatever happens, she will lose someone she loves. Seeing her weep, the surviving brother, Publius, kills Camilla for weeping over the enemy.

The principal sources for the story behind David's Oath are the first book of Livy (sections 24–26) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his Roman Antiquities.[4] However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own invention.[5][6]

It grew to be considered a paragon of neoclassical art. The painting increased David's fame, allowing him to take on his own students.[7]

In 1774, David won the Prix de Rome with his work Érasistrate découvrant la cause de la Maladie d’Antiochius. This allowed him to stay five years (1775–1780) in Rome as a student from the French government. Upon his return to Paris, he exhibited his work, which Diderot greatly admired; the success was so resounding that King Louis XVI of France allowed him to stay in the Louvre, a privilege greatly desired by artists. There he met Pecoul, the contractor for the actual buildings, and Pecoul's daughter, whom he married. The king's assistant, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, commissioned Oath of the Horatii with the intention that it be an allegory about loyalty to the state and therefore to the king. Nevertheless, David departed from the agreed-upon scene, painting this scene instead. Although the painting studies were begun in Paris, it was not painted in Paris, but in Rome, where David was visited by his pupil Jean-Germaine Drouais who had himself recently won the Prix de Rome. Ultimately, David's picture manifests a progressive outlook, deeply influenced by Enlightenment ideas, that eventually contributed to the overthrow of the monarchy. As the French Revolution approached, paintings increasingly referred to the loyalty to the state rather than the family or the church. Painted five years before the Revolution, the Oath of the Horatii reflects the political tensions of the period.

In 1789, David painted The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, a picture that was also a royal commission. Shortly afterward, the king went up to the scaffold also accused of treason, as the sons of Brutus, and with the vote of the artist in the National Assembly, which supported the execution of Louis XVI.

The painting depicts the Roman Horatius family, who, according to Titus Livius' Ab Urbe Condita (From the Founding of the City) had been chosen for a ritual duel against three members of the Curiatii, a family from Alba Longa, in order to settle disputes between the Romans and the latter city. 

As revolution in France loomed, paintings urging loyalty to the state rather than to clan or clergy abounded. Although it was painted nearly four years before the revolution in France, The Oath of the Horatii became one of the defining images of the time. In the painting, the three brothers express their loyalty and solidarity with Rome before battle, wholly supported by their father. These are men willing to lay down their lives out of patriotic duty. With their resolute gaze and taut, outstretched limbs, they are citadels of patriotism. They are symbols of the highest virtues of Rome. Their clarity of purpose, mirrored by David's simple yet powerful use of tonal contrasts, lends the painting, and its message about the nobility of patriotic sacrifice, an electric intensity. This is all in contrast to the tender-hearted women who lie weeping and mourning, awaiting the results of the fighting.[8]

The mother and sisters are shown clothed in silken garments seemingly melting into tender expressions of sorrow. Their despair is partly due to the fact that one sister was engaged to one of the Curiatii and another is a sister of the Curiatii, married to one of the Horatii. Upon defeat of the Curiatii, the remaining Horatius journeyed home to find his sister cursing Rome over the death of her fiancé. He killed her, horrified that Rome was being cursed. Originally David had intended to depict this episode, and a drawing survives showing the surviving Horatius raising his sword, with his sister lying dead. David later decided that this subject was too gruesome a way of sending the message of public duty overcoming private feeling, but his next major painting, The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons depicted a similar scene - Lucius Junius Brutus brooding as the bodies of his sons, whose executions for treason he had ordered, are returned home.  This was a subject the tragedy Brutus by Voltaire had made familiar to the French. 

The painting shows the three brothers on the left, the Horatii father in the center, and the three women along with two children on the right.  The Horatii brothers are depicted swearing upon (saluting) their swords as they take their oath. The men show no sense of emotion. Even the father, who holds up three swords, shows no emotion. On the right, three women are weeping—one in the back and two up closer. The woman dressed in the white is a Horatius weeping for both her Curiatii fiancé and her brother; the one dressed in brown is a Curiatius who weeps for her Horatii husband and her brother. The background woman in black holds two children—one of whom is the child of a Horatius male and his Curiatii wife. The younger daughter hides her face in her nanny's dress as the son refuses to have his eyes shielded.
According to Thomas Le Claire:

This painting occupies an extremely important place in the body of David’s work and in the history of French painting. The story was taken from Livy. We are in the period of the wars between Rome and Alba, in 669 B.C. It has been decided that the dispute between the two cities must be settled by an unusual form of combat to be fought by two groups of three champions each. The two groups are the three Horatii brothers and the three Curiatii brothers. The drama lay in the fact that one of the sisters of the Curiatii, Sabina, is married to one of the Horatii, while one of the sisters of the Horatii, Camilla, is betrothed to one of the Curiatii. Despite the ties between the two families, the Horatii's father exhorts his sons to fight the Curiatii and they obey, despite the lamentations of the women.[9]
This painting shows the neoclassical art style,[7] and employs various techniques that were typical of it:

David first exhibited the painting in Rome, where even the Pope requested a viewing.[6]

The painting was exhibited in France at the Salon of 1785, but it was delivered late.[6] David's enemies at the Academy took advantage of the delay to exhibit the painting in a poor locale in the gallery. The public's dissatisfaction with the painting's poor viewing conditions obliged the gallery to move it to a more prominent location.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3227124,"The Tennis Court Oath (French: Le Serment du Jeu de paume) is an incomplete painting by Jacques-Louis David, painted between 1790 and 1794 and showing the titular Tennis Court Oath at Versailles, one of the foundational events of the French Revolution. 

Political reversals and financial difficulties meant that David was never able to finish the canvas, which measures 400 by 660 cm and is now in the Musée national du Château de Versailles.

All the deputies are shown looking at Bailly, as a device to show their support for him. The only man to refuse to take the oath, Martin-Dauch, is shown in the lower right hand corner and provides a counterpoint to the general enthusiasm. David also drew all the faces in detail so that every figure was recognisable. Above are large windows with smiling figures of the public.

In the 18th century, an oath had a sacred value and guaranteed a person would be faithful to their word, as in David's own The Oath of the Horatii. During the French Revolution, collective oaths like the tennis court oath were considered as a factor in national unity and national unanimity. The tennis court oath – pre-Romantic, near-unanimous, almost totally middle-class, and with no popular violence – above all was considered the forerunner of the 1789 revolution and also showed that national sovereignty was made up of each individual's personal will.

David's painting also portrays the monk Dom Gerle alongside the Protestant pastor Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne, symbolizing a new era of religious tolerance. The wind blowing through the windows and billowing the curtains also symbolizes the wind of Revolution blowing through France.

This painting shows the three estates gathered together at an indoor tennis court after King Louis XVI locked the meeting hall at Versailles once he rejected to change the voting system. This is when Estate General proclaimed themselves as the National Assembly of France.

The first engravings showing The Tennis Court Oath only appeared in 1790, the year David convinced the Jacobin Club to launch a national subscription to fund a painting to depict the event. He exhibited a pen and brown ink drawing of his planned painting in the Louvre in 1791 but did not have enough money to follow it through as the subscription had only had a 10% take-up. The National Constituent Assembly thus decided to fund the work from the public treasury instead, topped up by selling engravings of the painting.[1]

David set up a studio in the former Les Feuillants Convent to hold sittings for the deputies, then meeting in the nearby salle du Manège. However, by 1793, he was too busy as a deputy himself to complete his sketch for the painting and French political life was no longer conducive to the work – Mirabeau, one of the heroes of 1789, had been declared an enemy of the Revolution on the discovery of his secret correspondence with Louis XVI and was now considered as a traitor by public opinion. A large number of deputies to the National Constituent Assembly had been identified as enemies of the Government of Public Safety. David therefore left the work unfinished and the subscribers reclaimed their engraving from him.[2]

David's 1810 The Distribution of the Eagle Standards and his 1814 Leonidas at Thermopylae were directly inspired by The Tennis Court Oath.[3] The work was also reprised and adapted by several artists from the late 18th century onwards. These included Auguste Couder in 1848 and Luc-Olivier Merson in 1883.[4]

In 1820, David ceded the engraving rights on Jean Pierre Marie Jazet's engraving of The Tennis Court Oath to Daniel Isoard de Martouret.[5] The canvas itself was finally acquired in 1836 by the royal museums for the Louvre, where it was exhibited from 1880 onwards.[6]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26250,"The Fifer or Young Flautist is a painting by French painter Édouard Manet, made in 1866. It is usually kept in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris.

On a trip to Spain in 1865, Édouard Manet visited the Prado, where the art of Diego Velázquez was a revelation. Upon his return to Paris in 1866, he began work on a new painting, depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army. In this picture, Manet presents the uniformed boy, in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of Vélazquez's court portraits, against a barely inflected, flattened background of neutral tone, thus frustrating attempts to assess the figure's true size and, by extension, importance.

The painting, entitled Le fifre, was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866. Outraged by the jury's decision, Émile Zola, an early champion of Manet's art, published a series of articles in the newspaper L'Évenement, that praised Manet's realist style and modern content.  Following the example of Gustave Courbet, in May 1867, Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the Éxposition universelle. The exhibition included Le fifre, which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting.

The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893. Between 1873 and 1893, the painting was owned by Manet's friend, composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure.  It was included in a large exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his premature death.

Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner, the Count Isaac de Camondo, and entered the national collections in 1911. It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947, when it was relocated to the Musée du Jeu de Paume. It was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983, the 100th anniversary of the artist's death.

In 1986, it was moved to its current home in the Musée d'Orsay, the national museum of 19th-century art.  It has since traveled in exposition; for example, in 2017 and 2018 it was on loan to the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum in Abu Dhabi, UAE.[1]

As with a painting by Velázquez, Manet conceived a shallow depth, where vertical and horizontal planes are barely distinguishable.[2] According to Peter H. Feist, in The Player fife, Manet showed the appeal of ""the decorative effect of a large single figure, with emphatic contours and placed before a background surface.""[3] Against a monochrome background, the figure is boldly highlighted with a reduced palette of colors mostly laid on in a thick impasto which brings forth the very sharp black of the jacket and shoes, along with the red pants, white strap, spats and so on. Thus, the figure stands ""firm, smooth and alive.""[4][2]

Moreover, as in Velázquez's work, Manet also portrayed an anonymous character, a teenage musician of the band of the Imperial Guard of Napoleon III, who was sent to Manet by commander Lejosne,[5] ""treated like a grandee of Spain.""[2] Additional models may have also posed for the figure: the likenesses of both Léon Leenhoff and Victorine Meurent have been seen in the boy's face and figure.[6]

A fictional tale concerning the painting forms the subject of an episode (""Art for Hogan's Sake"") of the American television series Hogan's Heroes, in which the work is stolen from the Louvre by a Nazi general and returned by the Allied POW's working with the French underground.[citation needed]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11771318,"The Virgin Mary, also known as Mater Dolorosa, although this title is now considered misleading,[1] is a late 1590s or early 1600s painting by the Greek born, Spanish Mannerist painter Doménikos Theotokópoulos (El Greco). It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 276.[2] A similar looking canvas in the Museo del Prado is considered a weaker replica.[1]

The Strasbourg painting was presented to the museum in 1892 by John Charles Robinson, who had strong commercial ties to its director, Wilhelm von Bode.[1] [The accession date was given as 1893 in previous publications.][2]

Mary is depicted with the face of an adolescent girl.[3] The portrait painting type corresponds to a variation of the Byzantine Theotokos, with which Doménikos Theotokópoulos was naturally familiar.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3006832,"The Wounded Cuirassier (French: Le Cuirassier blessé quittant le feu) is an oil painting of a single anonymous soldier descending a slope with his nervous horse by the French Romantic painter and lithographer Théodore Géricault (1791–1824). In this 1814 Salon entry, Géricault decided to turn away from scenes of heroism in favor of a subject that is on the losing side of the battle. On display in the aftermath of France's disastrous military campaign in Russia, this life-size painting captured the feeling of a nation in defeat.[1] There are no visible wounds on the figure, and the title has sometimes been interpreted to refer to soldier's injured pride.[2] The painting stood in stark contrast with Géricault's Charging Chasseur, as it didn't focus on glory or the spectacle of battle. Only his Signboard of a Hoofsmith, which is currently in a private collection, bears any resemblance in form or function to this painting.[3]

The final salon version of The Wounded Cuirassier is at the Musée du Louvre and the smaller, study version, is located at the Brooklyn Museum.

Théodore Géricault was born in Rouen, France in 1791 and studied art in the classroom from a young age. He went on to study in Paris where he created his first major work, The Charging Chasseur, for the Paris Salon of 1812. His next major Salon submission was The Wounded Cuirassier in 1814.

In the months before the exhibition, Paris fell to the sixth coalition and Napoleon was defeated and exiled from France. After The Wounded Cuirassier received a negative response from critics, Géricault entered a long period of artistic study, and in 1816 he left France to find inspiration in Rome.[4]

Géricault rushed to make The Wounded Cuirassier in only three weeks and created five separate sketches and drafts before the final version. Perhaps as a result of its hurried production, the message of the painting was not entirely clear to critics.[5]

Géricault uses a similar style and technique to his previous works, yet his approach to battle painting was unique in the period. He elected not to show a wound on the soldier, perhaps suggesting to viewers that the wound is internal and extends to the nation. The soldier and horse are shown in a tense and vulnerable state; the soldier uses his sword as a sort of crutch. Géricault also used the horse to convey emotion. In The Wounded Cuirassier, he uses the horse's facial expressions and uneasy footing to emphasize the unsteadiness and terror of the soldier.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q97729099,"Landscape with Tobias and the Angel is a large Baroque landscape painting created ca. 1670 by the Southern Italian painter Salvator Rosa. It includes a Christian theme from the Book of Tobit: Tobias and the archangel Raphael with the fish from the river Tigris. The painting is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 182.[2]

Landscape with Tobias and the Angel was painted in Rome, after the artist's 1662 journey to Venice. It was the first of a series of increasingly small and austere depictions of the subject. The large Strasbourg painting (of which three replicas exist, one of which is kept in the National Gallery, and another in the Wadsworth Atheneum) has been much praised for its expressiveness and its virtuosity since the 18th century. It was bought by Wilhelm von Bode in London in 1890; its previous history can be traced back to 1777, when it was bought at a Parisian auction by Louis-Antoine de Rohan-Chabot [fr] of the House of Rohan-Chabot.[1][3]

The depicted landscape is imaginary but probably inspired by the Phlegraean Fields of Rosa's Neapolitan home province, although some art historians have interpreted it as the Tiber Valley near Monte Soratte.[1]

Bazille's Studio (L'atelier de Bazille) is an oil-on-canvas painting created in 1870 by the French impressionist Frédéric Bazille in collaboration with Édouard Manet. It has been kept at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1986. It shows the artist himself surrounded by his friends in his studio, including the painters Édouard Manet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.[1][2]

Bazille shared the studio on the rue de la Condamine with Renoir from January 1868 to May 1870. The tall Bazille is center stage, holding a palette, having in his own words been ""painted in by Manet"". On the right, Edmond Maître, a friend of Bazille, is seated at the piano under a Monet still life. Manet is talking to Bazille and Renoir is seated.[1]

The pictures on the wall surrounding the artists are ones that had been rejected at some time by the Salon and for which Bazille is expressing his support.[1] Some of the paintings depicted are La Toilette (Montpelier, Musée Favre) above the sofa, Fisherman with a Net (Zürich, Fondation Rau) on the high left, and a large landscape with two people (Paysage avec deux figures) by Renoir (to the top right of the window, framed) of which only the lower left half survives (Woman with Bird).[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3119110,"The Orphan Girl at the cemetery[1] (also known as Young Orphan Girl in the Cemetery; French: Jeune orpheline au cimetière)[2] (c. 1823 or 1824) is a painting by the French artist Eugène Delacroix.

Believed to be a preparatory work in oil for the artist's later Massacre at Chios, Orphan Girl at the Cemetery is nevertheless considered a masterpiece in its own right. An air of sorrow and fearfulness emanates from the picture, and tears well from the eyes of the grief-stricken girl as she looks apprehensively upward. The dimness of the sky and the abandoned laying-ground are consonant with her expression of melancholy. The girl's body language and clothing evoke tragedy and vulnerability: the dress drooping down from her shoulder, a hand laid weakly on her thigh, the shadows above the nape of her neck, the darkness at her left side, and the cold and pale coloring of her attire. All these are combined to emphasize a sense of loss, of unreachable hope, her isolation, and the absence of any means of help.[2]

For Delacroix, colors were the most important ingredients for his paintings.  Because of this artistic taste and belief, he did not have the patience to create facsimiles of classical statues.  He revered Peter Paul Rubens and the Venetians.  He chose the use of colorful hues and exotic themes for his paintings, drawing inspiration from other inspirational places, resulting in works described as glossy and abundant with movement.[1]

The Young Orphan Girl in the Cemetery, an alternate title for the painting, is currently in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France.[1][2]
"
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q972295,"Leonidas at Thermopylae is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Jacques-Louis David. The work currently hangs in the Louvre in Paris, France. David completed the massive work (3.95 m × 5.31 m) 15 years after he began, working on it from 1799 to 1803 and again in 1813–1814.[1] Leonidas at Thermopylae was purchased, along with The Intervention of the Sabine Women, in November 1819 for 100,000 francs by Louis XVIII, the king of France. The piece depicts the Spartan king Leonidas prior to the Battle of Thermopylae. David's pupil Georges Rouget collaborated on it.


The crowded and theatrical scene that David depicts takes place in a time of war, seemingly in Ancient Greece from the Greek temple and temperate mountains in the background. The setting is the mountain pass in which the Battle of Thermopylae was about to be fought, in 480 BCE. Thermopylae was chosen as an ideal location for waging a defensive action in view of its narrow passage through the mountainous geography. This helped the Greeks make a better stand against the numerically vastly superior Persians, who were invading Greece.[2] King Leonidas, the Spartan leader, “delayed the invasion of Darius I and the Persians…by sacrificing himself and his men to give the Greeks the time they needed to organize an ultimately victorious resistance” in the long run.[3] This act of bravery and sacrifice by King Leonidas and his three hundred soldiers inspired David as France waged its own campaigns against rival European powers that wanted to restore France's pre-revolutionary ancien régime.[4] In 1813–14, when he finished the painting, European powers allied against the First French Empire were invading France to topple the emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, and David again found inspiration in the story of Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae.[5] 
When Napoleon Bonaparte saw the exhibit of David's latest paintings in 1799, “he criticized the lack of action and the fixed poses of the warriors in The Sabine Women.” This critique by one of David's heroes compelled David to revisit the classical ideals that inspired him (and the French Académie de Peinture et de Sculpture). The reworked masterpiece respects classical ideals of male virtue and beauty in its depiction of historical Greek warriors to convey an impression of heroic courage.[6]

David made many sketches before the final oil on canvas composition was executed. A sketch dating back to 1814 is a compositional study that was completed in two separate parts, leaving the final result somewhat choppy and overworked.[7] There are a few differences between this compositional study and the final painting, one of which being a more full view of the background which resulted from the removal of trees and branches from the earlier sketch.[8] Classical male figures were included from the beginning of David's sketches for Leonidas at Thermopylae.[9]

In Leonidas at Thermopylae, it is implied that the war is deeper than just the main figures in the foreground, with hundreds of other warriors in the battle too. In the foreground, we see that chaos has broken out and the army seems to be in shambles, while the leader of the army remains calm as the war progresses around him. The emphasized man in the center, presumably Leonidas, instantly draws the viewers’ eyes to him. Not only is Leonidas more bathed in light out of any of the partly shadowed figures in the painting, he also has the most static pose while almost everyone else is in motion. In this brief snapshot of a glimpse into an intense battle, he takes a moment to reflect on the war. While he is the leader of his army, Leonidas cannot do this alone; his eyes are upturned toward the heavens, as if to look up to God and beg for help. His facial expression is one of contemplation and almost defeat, as if he knows the fate of him and his army in the battle.

The contrast of the only other static man to the right of the leader serves to show that though Leonidas's figure is static, his risen state defines him as the ruler. The figures in the right background look up to Leonidas, signaling that the company sees him as divine. His idealized figure contributes to this notion too, relaying the idea of his strength and bravery during this battle. The golden embroidered cape, fancy helmet, and huge shield all contribute to the idea of Leonidas's high status and primary role in this battle.

On the left side, a soldier carves in rock the famous phrase (in Greek), ""Go, passer-by, to Sparta tell/Obedient to her law we fell"", conveying that Leonidas and his Spartans know their fate and are prepared to die, in the name of their country.[10]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3399448,"The Portrait of Madame Marie-Louise Trudaine is an unfinished 1791–1792 portrait of Marie-Louise Trudaine by the French painter Jacques-Louis David.[1] It was commissioned from David by her brothers-in-law, the Trudaine brothers, members of a family that had provided France with major civil servants such as Daniel-Charles Trudaine since the 17th century. The brothers welcomed David, the poet André Chénier, and other major artists of the time to their Parisian salon at place des Vosges. David became radicalized at the time of the French Revolution in 1792, was elected a deputy to the National Convention, and became an extremist—unlike the Trudaine family, who opted for obscurity.

The portrait of Madame Trudaine is an oil on canvas that shows her seated on a simple chaise, with her hands crossed on her lap and wearing a sober dress, a blue waist-sash and a white collar. Her expression is worried and reinforced by the tormented background and her unkempt hair. David left the portrait unfinished. It was acquired by the Louvre in 1890.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17491395,"Summary Execution under the Moorish Kings of Granada  (French: Exécution sans jugement sous les rois maures de Grenade) is an oil on canvas painting by Henri Regnault. Completed in 1870, it was acquired by the state from Regnault’s heirs for display at the Musée du Luxembourg. It is currently in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay.[1] A study for the figure of the executioner is also in the collections of the British Museum.[2]

The subject is a scene of decapitation that takes place in an architectural setting based on the Alhambra, suffused throughout with an sunset glow. A black executioner stands on a flight of marble stairs, calmly wiping the blood off his scimitar after striking his victim down. The brilliance of the colours contrasts with the repulsiveness of the subject.[3] The low angle at which the scene is depicted, effectively placing the viewer at the executioners feet, gives his life-sized figure an imposing presence.[4] His emotional detachment and relaxed gesture contrast with the gruesome foreground in which the blood drips down the steps from the lifeless body lying at his feet to its just-severed head.[1][5][6]

A fascination for arbitrary punishments carried out in settings of great splendour far from Europe was a common theme of Orientalist paintings. The power of these works drew on the contrast between what was depicted and contemporary European ideas about reducing the scope and barbarity of judicial execution, thus making the representation of the act both thrilling and terrifying.[5][7] They were also part of a wider tendency in orientalist art to choose disturbing subjects such as slave markets or acts of violence and present them in a style that was both “real” and escapist.[8]

In the late nineteenth century, the North African male body became the subject of homoerotic fascination for some Europeans. A hint of homoeroticism underpins the elegant, muscular figure of the executioner, suggesting fascination and threat.[4]

In technical terms, there is an extreme contrast between the meticulously detailed depiction of the architectural interior in the background and the gruesome realism of the spattering blood in the foreground. Regnault’s studio assistant Clairin reported that he literally threw the red paint at the canvas in order to get a completely natural effect.[5] There is also a tension between the “hyper-real” detail of the setting and the figures - Regnault made extensive and detailed sketches in preparation for the work, as well as working from photographs of the architectural motifs - and the fictional, fantasy world represented in the scene.[4] Regnault himself described the painting as showing “the richest civilisation and the keenest cruelty coexisting in titanic, frightful splendour.”[9]

The painting was Regnault’s third of his annual despatches to Paris after winning the Prix de Rome and it is possibly Regnault's most celebrated work.[3][10] Painted in Tangiers, it was first exhibited at 'Les Envois de Rome' at the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris in 1871.[2]  It has been exhibited on loan many times:[1]

fr:Roger Marx wrote that Regnault was often drawn, while in Rome, towards the unusual and the bizarre, such as the beheading in Benvenuto Cellini’s Perseus with the Head of Medusa. He also commented unfavourably on the painting’s lack of sympathy or pity.[11]

Henry Roujon admired the painting’s technical virtuosity and use of colour, but, like Marx, deplored what he considered the gratuitous horror of the subject, rendered without “emotion, anguish or pity.”[12] Gustave Geffroy considered it “vulgarly melodramatic.”[11]

John Charles Van Dyke’s view was that “people rather like the Regnault Execution scene, not because of its color and handling, but because it hints at a ghastly story, and they like the humanized monkeys, not because of any pictorial quality, but because they are funny.”[13]

This painting in the orientalist style is a good example of the ""passion for color and movement"" that gripped Chasseriau at this time. The equestrian portrait represents Ali Ben Ahmed, the leader of the Haraktas, in Algeria, who had invited Chassériau during his visit to Paris.[1] He appears triumphantly riding his brown horse, dressed in his typical Arab garment, followed by four members of his tribe, one of them black, also riding horses and holding spears. Clouds of dust rise from the horses' hooves. In the background at the right is an Arab city, with some buildings in Moorish style.

The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1845, where it received mixed reviews.[2] Chassériau was accused of doing a ""harmful imitation of the art of Delacroix"", although the painting was described as ""full of grandeur and majesty"".[3] He was also accused of a lack of science and firmness in the depiction of the horses, and was criticized for the way he painted the limbs of the leading horse in the foreground.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17627398,"Catharina Both van der Eem is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted in 1620 and now in Louvre Museum. It is considered a pendant portrait to the Portrait of Paulus van Beresteyn, in the same museum.


Similar to Hals' Portrait of a Woman Standing in Chatsworth House, this woman is wearing a wedding ring on her right forefinger, a figure-eight collar and lace wrist collars with gold bracelets. Her bodice is a richly embroidered Dutch wedding stomacher, and a heavy gold chain draped through a vlieger, rests on a wheel-shaped fardegalijn. Her diadem cap lacks wings and is more similar to the cap worn by Hals's unknown sitter Portrait of a Woman Standing (Kassel) and by his brewer Aletta Hannemans. Her portrait was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote:
155. CATHARINA BOTH VAN DER EEM, wife of Paulus Beresteyn. B. 10; M. 16. Three-quarter-length, life size. She is turned three-quarters left. She wears a lace cap, and a ruff trimmed with lace. She has a black dress with lace insertion in front and lace wristbands. Her left hand grasps her dress; her right rests on the back of a chair. In the left-hand top corner is her coat of arms. [Pendant to 154.] Inscribed, ""AETA. SVAE 40 1629.""; canvas, 54 inches by 40 inches. Purchased from the Hofje van Beresteyn, Haarlem, 1884, for the Louvre (100,000 francs, with 154 and the Beresteyn family group). In the Louvre, Paris, 1902 catalogue, No. 2387.[1]

Hofstede de Groot identified it as a pendant to 
154. PAULUS VAN BERESTEYN (June 15, 1588-December 27, 1636). B. 9; M. 15. Three-quarters length, life size. He is in profile to the right, but the head is seen in a three-quarter view. He wears a black flowered costume, with a white lace collar like a ruff and lace wristbands. He presses his right hand to his side and leans his left 

hand, which holds his hat, on a table. In the right-hand top corner are 


the family arms. [Pendant to 155.] The first numeral in the age has been altered in the inscription below to 4, and the last numeral in the date to 9. It would be better to read 30 and 1620. The style of painting, which is similar to that of the earliest groups of marksmen at Haarlem (431-3), makes the date 1620 probable. Inscribed, ""AETAT. SVAE. 40. 1629.""; canvas, 54 inches by 40 inches. See Moes, Iconographia Bafava, No. 519, 2. Purchased from the Hofje van Beresteyn, Haarlem, 1884, for the Louvre (100,000 francs, with 155 and the Beresteyn family group). In the Louvre, Paris, 1902 catalogue, No. 2386.[2]
In 1974 Seymour Slive listed both paintings as pendants of each other and confirmed the Hals attribution, which had been called into question in 1970.[3] Slive agreed with the traditional date of 1629 but felt that it could have been painted soon after the couple's marriage in 1619 as documented by E.A. van Beresteyn. He agreed with Numa S. Trivas that it was painted by Hals and not as some claimed, by Pieter Soutman. In 1989 Claus Grimm agreed with both earlier conclusions about the portrait of Paulus, but felt that Catharina's portrait was painted by Soutman.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16020875,"The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles is an oil-on-canvas painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, produced in 1801 for the Prix de Rome competition. It is now in the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in Paris.

It shows an episode from Homer's Iliad, in which Achilles refuses to listen to the envoys sent by Agamemnon to convince him back into the Trojan War. The topic assigned for the artists competing for the Prix de Rome in 1801 was the warriors' procession toward battle; Ingres' interpretation of the subject characteristically emphasized a moment of psychological drama instead of physical action.[1] The work was intended as a demonstration of Ingres' mastery of the human figure in classical history painting – Odysseus is shown in a red cloak derived from a sculpture by Pseudo-Phidias. 

The painting is in the neo-classical style and belongs to the school of Jacques-Louis David, in whose studio Ingres had trained. It also shows new influences from John Flaxman, whose work had just had its first Parisian exhibition.[2]

A small oil-on-wood sketch for the painting is in the collection of the nationalmuseum of Sweden.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17493706,"The Gallic Women: Episode from the Roman Invasion (French: Les Femmes Gauloises: épisode de l'invasion romaine) is a painting by Auguste-Barthélemy Glaize, from 1851. It is a very large oil on canvas work, with a height of 424cm and a width of 651cm. It was exhibited at the 1852 Salon and purchased by the French state in 1853.[1][2]

The painting illustrates the siege of Gergovie, at which Julius Caesar established Roman rule over Gaul. According to Caesar's own account, Gallic women harangued and insulted the Romans.[2] In the foreground on the right, a Roman horseman attacked by dogs, strikes women who have fallen to the ground. On the left lie dead or wounded Gallic soldiers and a woman is suffocating her children. Behind her, at the centre of the composition stands a group of Gallic women on a chariot. An old mother hides her daughter in her arms; another shakes her golden sickle while shouting; a third, implacable in her anger and in her hatred, holds the child she has just slaughtered to save him from the victors.[3] Behind them, women gesticulate on a cart drawn by an ox. On the right, the Romans continue their bloodthirsty and pitiless advance. In the background, fighting continues in the Auvergne mountains.[4][2]

The painting is a work of rehabilitation. Classical authors mostly considered that the outstanding trait of Gallic women as that they showed great fighting spirit; they were thought of as wild and dishevelled, hence typically barbaric. In contrast, Julius Caesar, in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico emphasised the submissiveness of the woman of Gergovie, who had begged the Romans to spare them. Glaize’s work portrayed them as neither barbaric nor suppliant but bold and defiant.[5][6] The theatrical postures and athletic bodies depicted recall the famous The Intervention of the Sabine Women by Jacques-Louis David.[2]

The painting was a new departure for Glaize who usually exhibited pieces dealing with mythological themes executed in a conventional and poetic manner.[7] It was acquired by the state because of its patriotic qualities - Glaize had transformed a historic defeat into an act of bravery that appealed greatly to the newly-proclaimed emperor Napoleon III. It was sent to the Musée Rolin in Autun, near the site of this historic battle of Alesia, where it remained until 1982. It was then assigned to the Louvre and put on display at the Musée d'Orsay. The Musée Rolin retains Glaize’s smaller scale study for the work (69.3cm x 97.7cm).[2]

Commenting on the works exhibited at the 1852 Salon, Marie-Noemi Cadiot remarked on the energy, character and grand scale of the painting, but felt the composition was let down by Glaize’s lack of skill as a colourist.[8] L'Artiste agreed, though it did praise the quality of light that was projected onto the figures, comparing it to the work of Le Sueur and Poussin.[9] Some however felt that rough cries and belligerent expressions of the women were excessively brutal.[10] fr:Alphonse Grün commented that Glaize had almost risen to the level of his subject; like others, he felt that the powerful subject and dramatic composition were let down by the poverty of colour, the facial expressions of the women, and some elements of the drawing.[11]

In 2016 the painting underwent extensive conservation and restoration work while remaining on public view. A glass barrier was erected around it so that the public could watch the conservators working on it.[12][13]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2872714,"The Self-portrait is a self-portrait painted by the artist Jacques-Louis David in 1794 whilst in prison at the hôtel des fermes for having supported the robespierristes. It was his third and last self-portrait - the second was the 1791 Aux trois collets (Uffizi, Florence). He gave it to his former student Jean-Baptiste Isabey and it then entered the collections of the Louvre in 1852 (inv. 3705).

The painting represents the artist facing himself, the bust in three-quarters, on a yellow-gray background. He is dressed in a dark overcoat with wide chestnut lapels and a white shirt, tied with a scarf of the same color. In his left hand he holds a brush, in the right a palette. He is seated on an armchair, the back of which can be seen. The figure is illuminated from the right. Because the portrait was painted from a mirror image, the positions of the hands are reversed; David does not correct this detail, which shows him holding the paintbrush in his left hand, although he is right-handed; similarly, the tumor that affects his left cheek is found on the right but is hidden in shadow.

David represented himself as a young man, which he is no longer since he was 46 when he painted this painting.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23946,"The Visitation  is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio, dating 1491.  It is displayed in the Louvre Museum of Paris, France.

The work was commissioned by Lorenzo Tornabuoni[1] for the church later known as Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi.

The Visitation refers to the meeting between St. Mary and St. Elizabeth described in the Gospel of Luke, Luke 1:39–56. The subject was set by Ghirlandaio with a large classical arch in the background featuring a landscape in the centre. Elizabeth, wearing a wide yellow vest, is paying homage to Mary and kneeling.

The painting features numerous details, including the refraction effects of the light, which Ghirlandaio studied from Flemish paintings at Florence. Others include: the frieze decorated with pearls and shells (allusions to Mary's purity), the light veil of the Madonna, the gilt brooch decorated with pearls and a ruby in the centre (this a hint to Jesus' future Passion) which holds her cloak. The  Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe of the Uffizi houses a preparatory drawing of Mary's cloak.

The two women at the sides are, as described by the inscriptions on the arch, Mary, mother of James, and Mary Salome.  In the Medieval context, the two were thought be daughters of St. Anne and thus the sisters or half-sisters of Mary.  In the Gospel narrative, they are not present at the Visitation; but in some interpretations of the crucifixion narrative, they are said to have been present at the foot of the cross, and their inclusion in the painting may be intended as a reference to the crucifixion. Salome's dress is a citation of Filippo Lippi's Bartolini Tondo, which was the inspiration for numerous similarly graceful figures in works by Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and others. 

Stylistic differences in the figures testifies the work of workshop assistants, perhaps Sebastiano Mainardi. On the lower right of the arch is the date MCCCCLXXXXI (1491). The city in the misty background could be a re-elaboration of Rome, as it includes a triumphal arch and the Pantheon.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15951407,"Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant is an oil painting created in 1905 by the French artist Robert Antoine Pinchon (1886–1943). Associated with the new generation of l'École de Rouen[1][2][3] Pinchon executed this work in a Post-Impressionist style with a subdued Fauve or Neo-Impressionist palette of golden yellows and incandescent blues. The dynamic image of the train in Pinchon's painting is an homage to the emerging industrialized world.

The work was exhibited in April 1905 at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen (see photograph), and again at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen; inauguration 13 November 1909. In the collection of François Depeaux at the time, Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant was purchased by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen in 1909 where it currently forms part of the permanent collection.[4]

Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 54 x 73 cm (21.25 by 28.75 in), signed R Pinchon lower left. The composition painted en plein air (sur le motif, in the open air), is dominated by the Pont aux Anglais, Rouen, with receding perspective tending towards the right side of the canvas. A locomotive and train cars pass over the bridge leaving a trail of steam in the direction of the receding perspective, carrying the eye towards the right, where below, a boat passes carrying two people a short distance from Le Pont aux Anglais. The rhythmic arches of the bridge and the speeding train create a sense of dynamism and modernity not often found in Post-Impressionist works. The colors Pinchon has chosen to depict this late afternoon scene are both warm and cool. The golden yellow highlights generated by the setting sun, off the canvas to the left, are juxtaposed against the grays, blues, violets and greens of the background hillside, the bridge and its massive base pillars, the poplar trees and the River Seine in the foreground.

The first railway station of Rouen was built on the left bank in 1843. The government authorized the continuation of the line to Le Havre and Dieppe the same year. It was therefore decided to build a bridge to the end of the Brouilly island (now connected to the Lacroix island), leading to the tunnel under the Côte Sainte-Catherine. The bridge, located in the Rouen metropolitan area, linking Paris and Le Havre, was named the English Bridge because many workers who built it were of English nationality. It is also called the Viaduc d'Eauplet, after the neighborhood where it is located.[5]

The bridge originally consisted of wooden arches resting on piles of masonry. It was located a little further downstream than the existing bridge. It was inaugurated in 1847. A few months after its inauguration, in 1848, two arches on the side of the left bank were set on fire during a riot. It was then rebuilt. In 1856 the wooden arches were replaced by cast iron. This is the bridge that Pinchon painted. These arches proved fragile and it was decided to build a new bridge in 1912. Despite its destruction during the Second World War, the bridge completed and operational in 1914 is still used today.[5]

Robert Antoine Pinchon's first solo exhibition in Paris took place on 15–25 March 1909 at the Galerie des Artistes Modernes run by Chaine and Simonson, with thirty works listed in the catalogue. The show resulted in both sales and press coverage. This was followed by another show at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen on 30 June. A few months later, on 13 November, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, opened a show with fifty-two paintings: three by Claude Monet, nine by Alfred Sisley, three by Armand Guillaumin, one by Auguste Renoir, thirteen by Albert Lebourg, five by Joseph Delattre, two by Charles Frechon and four by Robert Antoine Pinchon (now almost twenty-three years old); Péniches dans la brume, Vue pris du Mont-Garan, Effet de neige, and Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant.[1]

In 1909 Pinchon, Pierre Dumont, Pierre Hodé and Eugène Tirvert founded the Société Normande de Peinture Moderne, attracting the participation of Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Raoul Dufy, Maurice de Vlaminck, André Derain, Albert Marquet, Othon Friesz, Francis Picabia and Roger de La Fresnaye.[6] The same year, four paintings by Pinchon entered the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4992187,"The Portrait of Frédéric Chopin and George Sand was an 1838 unfinished oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Eugène Delacroix. 

He made sketches for it before 1838, a more detailed one of Chopin alone and another, more coarse one of the two.[3][1] Later he painted it originally as a double portrait, which was later cut in two and sold off as separate pieces. It showed composer Frédéric Chopin (1810–49) playing the piano while writer George Sand (1804–76) sits to his right, listening and sewing (a favorite activity of hers). The sitters were lovers at the time, and both were close friends of the artist.[4]

The portrait remained in Delacroix's studio until his death. Shortly afterward, it was cut into two separate works, both of which are tightly focused. Chopin's portrait comprises only a head shot, while Sand's shows her upper body but is narrowly cut. This led to the loss of large areas of the original canvas. The reason for the divide is likely the then-owner's belief that two paintings would sell for a higher price than one. Today Chopin's portrait is housed at the Louvre in Paris, while Sand's hangs at Copenhagen's Ordrupgaard Museum.[5]

George Sand was a French Romantic novelist, one of the first female French writers to establish an international reputation. She became known for behavior unusual for a woman at the time, including openly conducting affairs, smoking a pipe and wearing men's clothing.[6] Sand had been a friend of Delacroix for a number of years, though the painter did not hold her work in high regard. She met Chopin in 1836 and from 1838 conducted a relationship with him for ten years, until two years before he died. Much of the composer's best work was done during those ten years. Though their relationship began as physical, Chopin's failing health (described in Sand's autobiographical ""Winter in 
Mallorca""[7]) in time changed her role to that of caregiver. 

Sand introduced Delacroix to Chopin in 1838, and the two men remained close friends until the composer's death.
The double portrait showed Chopin playing the piano while Sand sat and listened.[5] Little is known of the painting's origin or the circumstances of its execution. It is not known whether it was a commission or intended as a gift to the composer. It is known that Delacroix borrowed a piano so that the work could be painted in his studio. The double portrait was not finished, and one of the elements that was not painted was the piano.[8]

The Sand canvas is generally seen as the more interesting because, in its original form, it was intended as a counterpoint to the Chopin portrait, not as a stand-alone work. As such, it contravenes many conventions of portraiture. It was usual in 19th-century bust-sized paintings for the subject to be largely static, but here Sand is shown reacting to the music Chopin is playing, and highly animated and energetic in her emotional response.[8]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9402747,"The Adoration of the Shepherds is a 1644 oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Georges de La Tour. It is now in the Louvre Museum, in Paris, which purchased it in 1926.[1][2]

The tradition of representing the theme of the adoration of the shepherds, taken from the Gospel of Luke, was very common in 17th-century painting, specially among the Caravaggesque painters, who transformed this episode into a nocturnal scene by candle light. La Tour, a painter strongly influenced by Caravaggio, departed from the traditional iconography of the birth of Christ in this painting. At first glance, the scene shows a group of five people sitting around a child in the light of a lit candle. It is the only source of light that falls on the faces of the gathered people, but thanks to the obscuring hand of an old man, that is Saint Joseph, the viewer has the impression that the glow radiates from the Child Jesus. Each person seems lost in their thoughts and their eyes appear directed towards Jesus. Among the gathered there is a second woman, a maid, holding a vessel of water. There is no donkey or ox among the animals, only a sheep that appears chewing the hay. The child is lying in a wicker basket and not in a manger, as the tradition says.

The shepherds are dressed in clothes contemporary of the painter. The Virgin is enhanced by her red robe, on the left, while Joseph carries the light, a traditional symbol of truth.[3]

The painting was probably commissioned by the citizens of the city of Lunéville, in 1644, as a tribute to the new governor, Maruiq de la Fert. For many years it was forgotten, until it was rediscovered in Amsterdam. It was purchased by the Louvre in 1926.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3201763,"The Worried Lover (L'Amante inquiète)[a] is an oil on panel painting in the Musée Condé, Chantilly, by the French Rococo artist Antoine Watteau. Variously dated to c. 1715–1720, the painting was among private collections throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, until it has been acquired by Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale, son of King Louis Philippe I; as part of the Duke of Aumale's collection at the Château de Chantilly, The Worried Lover was bequeathed to the Institut de France in 1884.

At 24 by 17.5 cm, the painting is a case of small, single-figure, and full-length composition showing a costumed character, often in Watteau's art;[2] it shows a seated young woman amid a landscape, dressed in pastoral attire, and holding a set of the cut roses, viewed by authors as a symbol of consumed love. With slight differences, the woman's figure has been adapted by Watteau from a double sanguine drawing, in which a study exactly matches the pose of the woman in the painting; Watteau also made an etching showing a woman seated in a very similar pose. In light of its provenance, The Worried Lover was related to two other paintings by Watteau, The Chord and The Dreamer.

The earliest known owner of The Worried Lover was the Abbé Pierre-Maurice Haranger (ca. 1655–1735), canon of the Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois who was one of Watteau's closest friends, inheriting a large number of the artist's drawings on his death.[3] In 1729, the painting was published by Edme-François Gersaint as an etching made by Pierre-Alexandre Aveline; Aveline also etched another Watteau painting owned by the Abbé Haranger, The Dreamer.[4] Though the prints don't mention the Abbé's ownership, Pierre-Jean Mariette confirms that in his manuscripts, and so does the fact that as part of the Recueil Jullienne, The Worried Lover and The Dreamer were printed on the same sheet.[5] Given the appearance in the Recueil Jullienne and shared provenance, some authors considered both paintings to be pendants;[6] in contrary to that point, Pierre Rosenberg stated that these were likely brought together in the Abbé's collection.[7]  It has also been presumed that The Worried Lover was no. 33 in the Abbé Haranger's inventory published in 1985, though the overall vagueness of the inventory makes that description elusive.[8]

In the 1780s, The Worried Lover resurfaced in the collection of Antoine Claude Chariot (1733-1815), the commissaire-priseur du Châtelet; along with another Watteau painting in the Chariot collection, The Chord, it was lot 44 sold at auction for 221 livres in January 1788 to the painter and art dealer Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Lebrun (1748-1813), the husband of the prominent portrait painter Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. Lebrun didn't keep the pair for long; he put it on sale in November 1791, only to have them bought back for 132 livres. The pair appeared as lot 25 at a later auction in February 1792, before resurfacing in the mid-19th century as part of the collection of Marquis André Joseph Maison (1798–1869), son of the prominent general and diplomat Nicolas Joseph Maison. Part of that collection, it was then bought in 1868 by Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale, the fifth son of King Louis Philippe I, during his English exile; upon his return to France, the Duke of Aumale hung it in the salle Caroline of his château de Chantilly, where it remains as part of the Musée Condé collection.[9][10][11]

Among Watteau scholars, The Worried Lover is dated from middle to late years of the artist's career.[12] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the painting was attributed by the Musée Condé curators to c. 1717–1720.[13] in a 1912 album and catalogue, the German historian Ernst Heinrich Zimmermann [de] placed it to c. 1717, the year Watteau completed the Louvre version of The Embarkation for Cythera.[14] In the 1950 catalogue raisonné, the Louvre staff curator Hélène Adhémar listed the painting as a Spring-Autumn 1716 work;[15] in 1959, the painter and connoisseur Jacques Mathey had proposed a c. 1715 dating.[16] In the 1968 catalogue raisonné, the Italian scholar Ettore Camesasca considered The Worried Lover a later work by Watteau, dating it c. 1720;[17] Camesasca's dating is also used by Federico Zeri.[18] in a later 1980 catalogue raisonné, the French historian Marianne Roland Michel dated the painting c. 1716–1718.[19]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3178376,"The Reading is an oil painting by French painter Édouard Manet, circa 1865 - 1873.[1]

The painting was first exhibited in 1880 in one of the regular solo exhibitions mounted by Manet in his workshop. The picture was also part of the great posthumous exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his death.

The work first belonged to the private collection of Winnaretta Singer, Princess Edmond de Polignac, where it remained until 1944, after the death of the Princess. It was offered as a gift to the French State and deposited in the Musée du Louvre. In 1947, it was transferred to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, a showroom located in the Jardin des Tuileries and which  belongs to the Louvre. It remained there until 1986, when, with the creation of the Musée d'Orsay, it was brought to this museum, like the rest of the collection of Impressionist paintings in the Louvre. It can currently be seen in the Musée d'Orsay, in room 31 of level 5.[2]

The painting depicts the artist's wife, Suzanne Manet (born Suzanne Leenhoff), seated, and their son, Leon, standing and reading a book. Leon was a recurrent model for Manet who portrayed him in several pictures, such as The Lunch, The Boy Carrying a Sword and The Bubbles of Soap.

In this work the white woman's dress dominates, and the sofa and curtains are treated with broad strokes of high brightness, in counterpoint to the dark tone of the belt and collar.[3] According to Peter H. Feist, in this painting ""Manet reacts more sensitive than usual, and looks especially to shades of white that are offered to his eyes"".[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3055367,"The Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople (Entrée des Croisés à Constantinople) or The Crusaders Entering Constantinople is a large painting  by Eugène Delacroix. It was commissioned by Louis-Philippe in 1838, and completed in 1840. Painted  in oil on canvas, it is in the collection of  the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

Delacroix's painting depicts a brutal episode of the armed expedition known as Fourth Crusade (12 April 1204), in which a Crusaders army abandoned their plan to invade Muslim Egypt and Jerusalem, and instead sacked the Christian (Eastern Orthodox) city of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The painting shows Baldwin I of Constantinople at the head of a procession through the streets of the city following the assault; on all sides are the city's inhabitants who beg for mercy or have been murdered.[1]

The painting's luminosity and use of colour owes much to Delacroix's study of the Old Masters, such as Paolo Veronese.[1] The painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1841, where the painterly romanticism of its style was controversial; Le Constitutionnel deplored ""the confused and strangled composition, the dull earthy colours and the lack of definite contours"", but Baudelaire appreciated the work's  ""abstraction faite"".[1]

The painting is used on the cover of the album ""The IVth Crusade"" by British death-metal band Bolt Thrower.

The Magpie (French: La Pie) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French Impressionist Claude Monet, created during the winter of 1868–1869 near the commune of Étretat in Normandy. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.

Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige).  Similar winter paintings of lesser quantity were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin.  Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.[1]

The Magpie is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet.  His first snowscape, A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur, was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with The Road in Front of Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter.  The Magpie was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting.  It was followed by The Red Cape (1869–1871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.[2]

The canvas of The Magpie depicts a solitary black magpie perched on a gate formed in a wattle fence, as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows.  The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eugène Chevreul earlier in the century.

At the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings.[3] The painting was privately held until the Musée d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.

In the late 1850s, French landscape painter Eugène Boudin (1824–1898) introduced Monet (1840–1926) to the art of painting en plein air—""in the open air"", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible metal paint tube (1841) and portable easel brought painting, formerly confined to studios, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. ""If I have become a painter,"" Monet said, ""I owe it to Boudin.""[4]

The landscape paintings of Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (1819–1891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862,[5] Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color.[6] ""Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master,"" Monet later reminisced.[7] ""It was he who completed the education of my eye"".[8] This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.

Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) had been painting effets de neige, ""snow effects"", from as early as 1856,[9] in a landscape style preferred by Japanese, Dutch, and Flemish artists. Influenced by Courbet, Monet painted his first snowscape, A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur (1865 or 1867).[10] A journalist observed:

We have only seen him once. It was in the winter, during several days of snow, when communications were virtually at a standstill. It was cold enough to split stones. We noticed a foot-warmer, then an easel, then a man, swathed in three coats, his hands in gloves, his face half-frozen. It was M. Monet, studying a snow effect.[11]
In A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur, Monet avoided the usual hunting genre and motifs used by Courbet. Instead, he focused on light and color in a new way by reducing the number of shades. Monet chose an earth tone color scheme and increased the number of shades of blue to highlight reflections on the snow.  Monet followed A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur with a notable series of snowscapes in 1867 including Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter.

In 1867, Monet's girlfriend, Camille Doncieux (1847–1879), gave birth to their son Jean in Paris. Lacking money, Monet returned to his father's house in Sainte-Adresse and lived with his aunt, leaving Doncieux and their child in Paris. Monet married Doncieux in 1870. Mme. Louis Joachim Gaudibert, an art collector, became Monet's first patron. Gaudibert helped Monet rent a house in Étretat for Doncieux and Jean in late 1868. Recovering from an episode of depression, Monet joined Doncieux and Jean at the house in Étretat in October, with Doncieux in the role of muse and life model.[12] By December, Monet was in great spirits, ""surrounded by everything that I love"", and began to focus on painting. In a letter to Frédéric Bazille (1841–1870), Monet wrote:

I spend my time out in the open, on the shingle beach when the weather is bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the countryside which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.[14]
Although he enjoyed living with Camille and Jean in Étretat, Monet preferred to paint alone in the countryside. He told Bazille:

Don't you think that directly in nature and alone one does better?...I've always been of this mind, and what I do under these conditions has always been better. One is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall have felt, I myself, personally.[15]
During his time in Étretat, Monet completed three paintings of fishing boats,[16] one of a rural road,[17] and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133).[18] Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The Magpie is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes,[19] the largest in its class.[20] The exact location of the snow scene depicted in The Magpie is unknown.[21] Ralph T. Coe proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in Honfleur.[22]

Monet submitted The Magpie and Fishing Boats at Sea (W 126) to the Salon of 1869.[23] Both paintings were rejected in April.[24] Critic Paul Richard said that the jurors rejected the painting as ""too common and too coarse"".[25] Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury.[26] Monet told French novelist Arsène Houssaye (1815–1896), ""This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, and in spite of my low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me.""[27] A century later, The Magpie was acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1984.[28] It became one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.[29]

In the painting, a black magpie is perched on a gate in a wattle fence as sunlight falls on fresh white snow, creating shadows. With no human figures present, the bird on the gate becomes the focus.[30] Michael Howard of Manchester Metropolitan University called the painting ""an extraordinary evocation of the snow-bound chill of a late winter's afternoon. The blueness of the long shadows creates a delicate contrast with the creamy whites of the sky and landscape"".[31] Curator Lynn Orr, then of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, noted Monet's interest in the changing light that depended on the hour and the vagaries of the atmosphere:[32]

Unusual weather phenomena, such as snow and mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the chromatic appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under the combination of a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.[33]
The Magpie is an early example of Monet's investigation of colored shadows. In this piece, Monet makes use of the complementary colors of blue and yellow. The shadow produced by yellow sunlight shining on the snow gives the impression of a blue-violet color,[34] the effect of simultaneous contrast. French Impressionists popularized the use of colored shadows, which went against the artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and desaturating the color. Colored shadows can be directly observed in nature, particularly in the type of snow scene presented by Monet.[35] In his study of Impressionism, art historian John Rewald observed that artists used snowscapes to ""investigate the problem of shadows"".[36] The problem is summarized by Fred S. Kleiner in Gardner's Art Through the Ages:

After scrutinizing the effects of light and color on forms, the Impressionists concluded that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified by the quality of the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.[37]
Monet's use of colored shadows arose from color theories that were popular in the 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) published one of the first modern descriptions of colored shadows in his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (1643–1727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (1786–1889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839).[12] Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work.[38] Georges Seurat (1859–1891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (1831–1902).[39]

Monet's series of 11 paintings depicting The Bridge at Argenteuil (1874) also explored the use of colored shadows in its portrayal of the blue and purple shadow on the top portion of the bridge.[40] Over the years, Monet became more and more obsessed with color and light. When his wife was dying in September 1879, Monet painted her in Camille Monet on Her Deathbed (1879), noting the ""blue, yellow, grey tones"". Monet told his friend, French statesman Georges Clemenceau (1841–1929), that he spent the time ""focusing on her temples and automatically analyzing the succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face.""[41] Camille died from cancer at the age of 32. After her death, Monet largely ceased painting people, focusing instead on natural landscapes.[42] Monet later returned to painting snow and colored shadows with Grainstacks Snow Effect (1891).[43]

In honor of the 150th anniversary of Monet's birth, the Principality of Monaco issued a stamp of The Magpie in 1990, designed by French engraver Pierre Albuisson.[44]

French design studio Les 84 created a 3D version of The Magpie for the 2010–2011 Monet exhibition at the Galeries nationales du Grand Palais.[45]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3399388,"Portrait of Doña Isabel de Requesens y Enríquez de Cardona-Anglesola is an oil painting dated circa 1518 that was formerly believed to depict Giovanna d'Aragona. It has been variously ascribed to Raphael, Giulio Romano, or the school of Raphael; it is now usually taken to have been executed by Giulio Romano based on a sketch by Raphael and then altered by Raphael. The painting is now in the Louvre Museum in Lens.

The portrait of ""the vicereine of Naples"" was commissioned from Raphael in 1518 by Cardinal Bibbiena on behalf of Pope Leo X for Francis I of France, who collected portraits of beautiful women.[1][2] Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme took the description to refer to Giovanna d'Aragona (1502 – 1575);[3][4] a study in 1997 demonstrated that the subject was rather Isabel de Requesens, the wife of Ramón de Cardona, who was viceroy of Naples from 1509 to 1522.[5] According to Vasari, Raphael sent Giulio Romano, one of his young assistants, to Naples to paint the portrait, except for the face, which he was responsible for;[1][5][6] documentary evidence survives in Raphael's hand confirming Giulio Romano's work on this commission.[7] The face has indeed been altered;[8] otherwise Vasari's description might also apply to another portrait which has been attributed to Giulio Romano and Raphael, Isabella of Aragon as Mona Lisa, depicting Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan, also known as Isabella of Naples.

Opinions have varied as to who executed the cartoon for the Portrait of Doña Isabel de Requesens, which was likely reused for that of Isabella of Aragon; Luitpold Dussler considered the painting entirely Giulio Romano's work.[9] However, both portraits are now generally thought to have been executed to Raphael's design, and the two paintings have been referred to as Raphael's Giocondae for their visual references to Leonardo's Mona Lisa (also known as La Gioconda), which was already in Francis I's collection.[10] It is also possible that the portrait of Isabella of Aragon is a copy;[11] the gallery that holds it, the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome, lists it as ""after"" Raphael.[12]

A number of copies of the painting exist, and Vasari states that one copy entirely by Giulio Romano was made at the same time and included in the gift to the king; Brantôme reported having seen one version in the king's apartments at Fontainebleau, the other in the queen's.[4]

The Portrait of Doña Isabel de Requesens was restored by Francesco Primaticcio in the mid-16th century[13] and transferred from the original wood to canvas either then[14] or in the 18th century.[15]

The subject is portrayed seated, turned to the viewer's left, wearing a deep red velvet dress trimmed with gold whose sleeves are slashed to reveal the cream fabric of her chemise, and a hat with jewels on the brim, whose shape suggests a halo. She is portrayed in three-quarters length, one hand fingering the fur around her shoulders, the other resting on one knee. In the background a woman leans against the railing of a loggia overlooking a garden; the vault is a visual quotation from the story of Cupid and Psyche as painted by Raphael on the ceiling of the Loggia di Psiche at the Villa Farnesina in Rome.[1] Her loose hair, the red garments (the colour of love for Petrarch), and her meeting the viewer's gaze are all sensuous details; further, the portrait is innovative in including her knees, which in addition are visibly parted, and in not having her hands chastely together as a barrier.[1] The composition corresponds to that of other Raphael portraits in being based on the musical ratio 9/12/16.[16]

Both Isabel de Requesens and Giovanna d'Aragona were famous beauties; Giovanna was the subject of a poem by Agostino Nifo, ""De pulchro et amore"", and it has been suggested that the beauty in the painting was as much formulaic as true to life.[17]

Both Giocondae portraits feature carved cats on the right which resemble lions, a punning allusion to Leonardo.[18] The woman in the background is replaced by a man in the portrait of Isabella of Naples; they may allude respectively to the sitter and the artist in the Mona Lisa.[19]

Manet likely had this painting in mind when he painted his regal picture of his wife Suzanne, The Reading.[20]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3802301,"The Allegory of Isabella d'Este's Coronation  is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Lorenzo Costa the Elder, dating to about 1505–1506.  It is displayed in the Louvre Museum of Paris, France.

The painting was the fourth commissioned by Isabella d'Este for her studiolo, after two canvasses by Andrea Mantegna (Parnassus and the Triumph of the Virtues, respectively from 1497 and 1499-1502) and Perugino's Combat of Love and Chastity (1503). 

The subject was provided by the court poet Paride of Ceresara and was initially assigned to Mantegna. However, after the latter's death in 1506, he was replaced by Lorenzo Costa, who deleted all the work made by his predecessor. Isabella liked the painting, and this granted Costa the position as the new court painter of the Gonzaga of Mantua.

Duke Charles I of Nevers gifted this and the other paintings in the studiolo to Cardinal Richelieu, and the Allegory thus went to Paris. After belonging to several collections, it became part of the collections of the Louvre Museum.

The most accepted interpretation of the painting is an exaltation of Isabella d'Este, her rule and her role as patron of the arts, which generates harmony. She would be the figure in the center, crowned with laurel by Anteros, who is held by his mother, Venus: the two mythological figures would symbolize the heavenly and virtuous love, compared to the earthly and carnal one.

The scene would be in the garden of Harmony, where it is possible to freely practice Music, Arts and Poetry, which are referred to by the characters surrounding the coronation.  In the foreground, behind the garden's boundaries, are Diana, symbol of chastity, and Cadmus (on the left), protectors of the arts such as Mercury, identified by the scene of battle behind him on the painting's left. The two female characters sitting on the ground are identifiable with the Virtues who watch over Isabella's world: the one crowning the ox would be Perseverance, the one crowning the lamb would be Purity or  Innocence.

Another interpretation is that based on the Tabula Cebetis: the painting would represent the different genres of poetry, the foremost of which is lyrics, portrayed by Venus in the center. The character being crowned would be Sappho, and the personifications around her would be outstanding early lyricists such as Callimachus, Propertius, Ovid and Tibullus.

Portrait of Clemenceau is an oil painting on canvas of 1879–80 by Édouard Manet, now in the Musée d'Orsay. The work can be dated via two letters of 9 December 1879 and 8 January 1880 from their subject fixing sitting dates.[1] Clemenceau was not happy with the work, stating ""My portrait by Manet? Very bad, I don't have it and I don't mind that. It is at the Louvre, I ask myself why we put it there"".[2] But he enjoyed the sittings at Manet's home, enjoying the conversation and finding the painter very spiritual.[3]

Manet's youngest brother Gustave was a municipal councillor in Paris and it may have been through his mediation that Manet met Clemenceau. Alternatively, the pair may have met at the home of Paul Meurice or Émile Zola. On Manet's death his daughter Suzanne gave the work to its subject. When Mary Cassatt brought her American friend Louisine Havemeyer to Clemenceau's home, Louisine sold her the work for 10,000 francs in 1905. Madame Havemeyer then donated it to the Musée du Louvre in 1927,[4] from which it was later assigned to its present home.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2633689,"Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Piero di Cosimo, dating from about 1480 or 1490. It is in the Musée Condé in Chantilly, France.

Simonetta Vespucci was a Genoese noblewoman who married Marco Vespucci of Florence at the age of either 15 or 16, and who was renowned for being the greatest beauty of her age - certainly of the city of Florence. She was admired by all of Florence for her beauty, which later became a legend after her premature death in 1476 at the age of 23. Sandro Botticelli was inspired by her features in The Birth of Venus and Piero di Cosimo was a passionate admirer.

The subject is a young girl portrayed at half length in profile, facing left. Her breasts are bared and a small snake twines around the necklace she is wearing. In the background is an open landscape, arid on the left and lush on the right. The dark clouds are a symbol of her early death, as is the dead tree in the background.[1] At the base of the painting is a border with an inscription that mimics carved letters, a method used in art since the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck at the beginning of the century; it reads: SIMONETTA IANUENSIS VESPUCCIA.

The dark clouds contrast with the pure profile of the face and the clear complexion. It is traditionally identified as a portrait of Simonetta. Giorgio Vasari regarded her as portraying Cleopatra, because of the toplessness and the snake, which he identified with the asp with which, according to Plutarch, Cleopatra committed suicide. However, the art historian Norbert Schneider regards it as more likely that the iconography of the portrait derives from that in late Classical antiquity, in which the snake, especially biting its own tail, symbolized the cycle of time and hence rejuvenation, and was thus associated with Janus, the Roman god of the new year, and with Saturn, who became a ""Father Time"" figure because his Greek name, Kronos, was conflated with Chronos, meaning ""time"". The inscription refers to Simonetta as Januensis (of Genoa, but the variant spelling punning on Janus). The snake was also the symbol of Prudentia; in that interpretation, it would be praise for Simonetta's wisdom.[2]

An alternative suggestion is that she is presented as Proserpina, with the snake symbolizing the pagans' hope of resurrection.[3][4]

The bust, in 15th-century style, is slightly turned towards the spectator, so as to favour the view, and her shoulders are wrapped in a richly embroidered cloth. According to Schneider, her naked breasts would not have caused any offense to contemporary viewers. They were rather an allusion to Venus Pudica, or the ""chaste"" Venus, and in Paris Bordone's allegories of lovers (c. 1550) toplessness is a symbol of the wedding.[2]

Her features have a surprising purity. The forehead is high, according to the fashion of the time which included a shaved hairline. The hairstyle is that of a married woman, gathered up in braids and richly decorated with ribbons, beads, and pearls.

It is uncertain how closely the painting resembles Simonetta Vespucci, particularly since if it is a portrait of her, it is posthumous, having been painted about 14 years after her death. When she died, Piero di Cosimo was only 14 years old, so it is possible that it could be a copy of a work by an earlier artist.

The Musée Condé questions the identification of the subject, titling the painting Portrait of a woman, said to be of Simonetta Vespucci, and stating that the inscription of her name at the bottom of the painting may have been added at a later date.[5]

Several art historians have linked the work to Lambert Sustris's Venus and Cupid. In 1897 the painting was given by Couturier de Royas to the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon, where it still hangs.

Delacroix had suffered a sentimental or sensual crisis between 1825 and 1827 which led him to paint many more or less erotic works – according to his private journal from the time, completing the paintings was thus intertwined with the sexual satisfaction before the young model went away.

The model for this work may be Mademoiselle Laure, who also appears in the same artist's The Death of Sardanapalus and Greece Among the Ruins of Missolonghi, both dating to the same time. Another possibility is Rose, another of his models.[1]

It was commissioned by Philibert Rivière de L'Isle, an influential court official in the Napoleonic Empire,[1] along with portraits of his wife, Philibert and their daughter, Caroline.[2]

The couple also has a son, Paul, who was not portrayed.[3] The three portraits comprised Ingres' first major commission, were completed when he was c 23 years old. They are each very different in tone and approach, but were highly successful from an artistic point of view, and all considered among his early masterpieces.[4]

As an official commission, the painting is very different from Ingres' earlier male portraits, which were mostly informal descriptions of friends. Philibert is shown in an official pose, sitting on a highly ornate and expensive chair, and posed beside a table draped with a red velvet cloth, and containing documents related to his office. His hand is tucked inside his vest, in a pose reminiscent of Napoleon.[3]

The painting was influences by the work of Jacques-Louis David, in particular his amiable portraits of Pierre Sériziat and Gaspar Mayer. Here Rivière may appear imposing, while also relaxed and friendly.[4] The painting is very flat and spatially restrictive.

This Baroque painting evokes great power and a dynamic quality. Preti was influenced by the pathetic and dark art of Caravaggio. It has a theatrical character while the architectural elements serve as a backdrop. Sophonisbe is pale and disfigured, it seems to be showing the rapid effect of the poison she has just taken. Her left hand rests on her chest, and she holds the poison with the right hand. The pallor of her face demonstrates the accomplished effect of her fatal act. Massinissa wears a red toga over the shoulder representing both murder and destructive love. Sophonisbe wears blue fabric, a rare color reserved for important people. This love is also highlighted by the putto, a little angel, representative of Baroque art. All viewers are directed towards Sophonisbe, the main character of the scene. A woman in the lower right hides her nose with a handkerchief as a sign of anxiety. The sky, which can be seen at the top right, is covered by many clouds ranging from gray to black. These colors that darken the sky refer to the death of Sophonisbe.[2]

In 1802, the painting was acquired by the Neapolitan government to be given to France in compensation for the paintings taken from the French deposits of the Church of Saint-Louis-des-Français in Rome. In 1804, the painting arrived in Paris. It is held at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.

In 1987, the painting was restored after an examination by the LRMF (French Museums Research Laboratory) in the Versailles workshops. The examination revealed the presence of several changes, including a horizontal seam in the middle part of the painting (passing at the level of the neck of the figure receiving the cut) and the whole of the pictorial layer has been obscured by a very thick greenish-brown varnish. The edges of the painting had been cut during the previous relining (a restoration operation). The restoration consisted of reattaching the previous layer, lightening the varnish and eliminating the repaints by removing with a scalpel any astic, grime and accumulations of varnish. Then, the work was subjected to the resumption of wear and the painting of the re-harmonization glazes in watercolor on the right forearm of the man in armor. The restoration ended with a general varnishing of the work.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56648720,"The Chariot of Death is a large allegorical painting by Théophile Schuler. It was gifted to the Unterlinden Museum by the artist in 1862. Its inventory number is 88.RP.454.[2] The painting is considered one of the most emblematic of the collection (which includes the world-famous Isenheim Altarpiece).[3][4] A drawn copy of the painting is kept in the Cabinet des estampes et des dessins.[5]

The painting was begun by Schuler (then 27 years old) after his return to his hometown of Strasbourg, under the impression of the Revolutions of 1848, specifically the French Revolution of 1848, which he had witnessed in Paris. Schuler worked on its completion until 1851, during which time he became witness to the counter-revolutionary backlash, which confirmed the pessimism and the anguish of his vision of the 1848 upheavals and turmoil.[3][6]

The Chariot of Death is inspired by medieval and early Renaissance Dances of Death, especially Hans Holbein the Younger's. As with older depictions, Schuler's painting shows people from all ages and walks of life: a pope, a king, a young mother (modelled on the artist's sister), a fool, a poet, a sick man, a lawyer, a murderer, a Native American, an Arab, a young Napoleon... being taken away by death. A special emphasis is placed on artists (among them Dante and a self-portrait of Schuler), who are at the top of the pyramidal composition, and on French revolutionaries, with whom Schuler had empathized.[3][5][6]

Schuler depicts different personifications of Death: one is the angel of death in the centre of the painting, a young and beautiful but cold-faced woman with black hair and black wings, who drives the chariot while looking straight at the viewer; the other is a skeleton in a shroud, in the lower right corner of the painting, which is shown grabbing an executioner with its right hand, while dramatically driving the Wandering Jew (a common trope of anti-Judaism) away with its left hand.[1][6] On the opposite side of the diagonal starting bottom right with the Wandering Jew is a wayside cross, which the chariot is only driving by. Schuler thus raises the question of the meaning of death and alludes to the inability of religion to provide an answer.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5792618,"The Birth of the Virgin is a 1661 painting by the Spanish artist Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. 

He painted it for the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception in Seville Cathedral, from which it and the same artist's Immaculate Conception were looted by French troops under marshal Jean de Dieu Soult. The French had hoped to confiscate The Vision of Saint Anthony of Padua, but the city council proposed to exchange that work for Birth and it was thus removed from the chapel. It is now in the Louvre in Paris.

It is one of the most important works in the artistic production of Murillo, who based himself on models of daily life in Andalusia to create the painting. Apart from the presence of angels and the halo of the Virgin, there is no other clue that shows that this is a painting with a religious theme.

The figure of the Virgin Mary is at the center of the composition, supported in the arms of various women, at the same time as a source of light emanates which illuminates the whole scene, although the group of Saint Anne remains in the shadows, incorporated in the bed. Saint Joachim also appears.

The play of light that Murillo employs recalls the works of Rembrandt, which the painter may have admired in private collections.

A light from above provides some illumination, highlighting her perfectly spotless white dress. There is not much variation in color; only muted earthy tones of brown, green, and grey are present aside from the draperies of the model.[1] Madame Récamier appears separate and distinct in her own space, a sparsely decorated setting with Classical furniture in the Pompeian style.[2] The woman reclines on her French méridienne sofa, also known as a fainting couch, popular in the 19th century. Her pose suggest grace and elegance through the curvature delineated by the lines of her legs, back, and arm. The horizontal portrait format was innovative for its time, when vertical compositions were most common.[3]

The composition is unfinished, as indicated in the communications between the artist and Madame Récamier, as well as in undeveloped areas of the work. In letters that survive between Mme. Recamier and David, she says 'je serai à vos ordres pour la séance"", meaning ""I will be at your service for the session"". However she was consistently late for her sittings and rather spoiled, leading to a quarrel between the model and artist, and the work was never retouched.[2] Only Récamier's head is completely finished, with great detail given to each lock of hair, which has been finely styled and arranged, as well as her porcelain cheeks dabbed with rouge. Yet her dress lacks any highlights, and the accompanying furniture, floor, and background are rendered in loose brushstrokes. In some areas, the priming layer is visible.[2]

Madame Juliette Récamier was a Neoclassical French icon, salon hostess, and influential Parisian socialite in elite French circles of the time. Wife of a French banker and daughter of a banker from Lyon, she was considered to be among the most beautiful socialites of her time. She was rarely seen without an entourage of male suitors.[5] and was renowned for both her wit and romantic affairs. The esteemed French poet and dramatist Théophile Gautier wrote of her ""indescribable attraction, like the poetry of the unknown"".[6] Prominent authors, such as Mme. de Stael, modeled some of her protagonists on Récamier.

It was at the age of 23 that she began to model for various artists of the early 19th century in France, including David. Her likeness was captured in David's Neoclassical portrait, yet was abandoned, much to the subject's dismay. Originally, he intended to capture not only her appearance, but also the ideals of femininity and charm.[1] David began the painting in May 1800 but may have left it unfinished when he learned that Récamier, having grown impatient with David, commissioned his student François Gérard to paint her portrait (Gerard's portrait was completed in 1805). David's painting was acquired by the Louvre in 1826, over twenty years after it was begun. Yet it was warmly welcomed, and according to Scottish painter and art critic, D.S. MacColl, ""from 1826 his unfinished Madame Recamier has spoken for something better in the Louvre, and since then a whole series of portraits have accrued which will prove his lasting security when 'Horatii,’ 'Sabines,’ and the rest have gone the dusty way to respectable oblivion"".[3]


In Creatures in an Alphabet, Djuna Barnes wrote of the subject as:
The Seal, she lounges like a bride,

Much too docile, there's no doubt;

Madame Récamier, on side,

(if such she has), and bottom out.[7]

Despite David's opinion, shared by most at the time, that portraiture was a lesser genre of painting, his works in the genre were widely celebrated among his contemporaries, many of whom posed as his subjects. Other portraits made in David's circle during the period exemplify the Neoclassical approach to portraiture. Portrait of a Young Woman in White depicts a fair, young Frenchwoman in Roman dress, adorned with a Roman pillar, sumptuous royal maroon draperies, and other historic elements offset by contemporary feminine qualities that would have been recognized by viewers.[8] This piece is visually and thematically consistent with the techniques used in the 1800 painting of Madame Récamier.

Because of her prominence in French society, Madame Récamier was painted by many artists. François Gérard created several portraits of her, including an 1805 portrait and an 1829 crayon noir. The 1805 portrait bears similarities to David's composition, yet is more saccharine and feminine, and emphasizes the Roman influences with a background of such architecture and garments.The work is not as coyly coquettish as David's; Récamier directly addresses her audience, gazing into the viewer's eyes with a downturned, sweet smile that radiates the gracefulness of her soft demeanor. Additionally, Antoine-Jean Gros produced a portrait of her later in life, from the year 1825, wherein she is depicted in the Romantic style in elaborate costume and coy position, consistent with previous portraits of her yet respecting her graceful aging.

David, Gros, and Gerard were not the only artists to use Madame Récamier as a subject; the terracotta bust by Joseph Chinard of the Parisian socialite from 1801 similarly captures her elegance. Here, she conceals her left breast while exposing her right, evoking a coquettishly feminine demeanor.[6] The juxtaposition established here between the figure of the classical nude and the suggestion of sexual behavior is the essence of this Neoclassical revival.[9]

The work has had substantial implications in the art world. The sofa on which Madame Récamier reclines is now known as a récamier, a backless couch with a high curved headrest and low footrest.[10] Récamier had such seats in her own Salon, now housed at the Louvre.[11]

The notable form and iconography of David's work has rendered it a staple in the history of art, and many artists have taken inspiration from the composition. The pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder was adopted in 1814 by Ingres for his Grande Odalisque. Twenty-first century artist Meredith Frampton directly borrowed the position of Madame Récamier for the pose of Marguerite Kelsey, a British model, in her 1928 portrait. The British Art Journalcompares the two works: ""The [artist's] portrait of Marguerite Kelsey likewise encapsulates classical qualities of order and calm, the model's white dress and presentation on the sofa recalling the celebrated neoclassical Portrait of Madame Recamier by Jacques-Louis-David (1800, Louvre).[12]

Prominent surrealist painter René Magritte also parodied David's painting in his Perspective: Madame Récamier by David, showing a coffin reclining, now in the National Gallery of Canada. The series features several works, all based on David's painting. Magritte recreates David's composition, but the model is a coffin, not a fair-skinned Parisian beauty. Both death and laughter are recurrent themes in Magritte's series, in which the original individual is replaced by the macabre. This sense of morbidity is counteracted with the humor of the piece, hinting at the inevitability of death and the ephemerality of life—a far cry from David's intended message with his original portrait.[13] The series nonetheless conveys a powerful allegory of the delicate nature of human life, through intense visual contrast and typical surrealist darkness.[14]

The Plague of Ashdod is also known as The Miracle of the Ark in the Temple of Dagon, by the French artist Nicolas Poussin. The painting represents a story from 1 Samuel in the Old Testament. The original painting currently hangs in the Louvre in Paris. Poussin was commissioned to paint The Plague of Ashdod by Fabrizio Valguarnera. Fabrizio Valguarnera was a Sicilian merchant who was put on trial for laundering money through the purchase of this painting; he also commissioned more than one version of this piece.[1] Poussin painted this during a plague that took place in Italy from 1629 to 1631, which influenced his accurate portrayal of the epidemic.[2]

Nicolas Poussin was a French artist who was born in 1594 in Les Andelys, Normandy. Poussin's life ended in Rome in 1665. During the time that Poussin began working on this commission of the Plague of Ashdod, there was a terrible bubonic plague outbreak in Italy from 1629 to 1631. Poussin was then living in Rome, which the plague actually did not infect at this time; however, Poussin was still influenced by this epidemic when creating the Plague at Ashdod. Many who have studied this painting by Poussin have been fascinated with his advanced knowledge of the nature of the epidemic.[2] Poussin wrote his Observations on Painting after 1627. His writings and observations included his understanding of the epidemic. It had valuable information that gave insight to the plague; however, the text was never completed.[2] In these writings, Poussin discusses Aristotle’s concept of loyalty.[2] To describe people who lack loyalty, Aristotle used the example of family members who murder each other due to contagion. Poussin describes how Aristotle wrote about family members murdering each other because of the fear of disease. Poussin symbolized this lack of loyalty by portraying a man ripping a child away from the corpse of the baby's mother. This might possibly lead to this man's own demise just like that of a child so attached to his or her own mother would become infected with the plague and die as well. This lack of loyalty is shown all throughout this painting.[2]

The subject of this painting comes from a story in the Book of Samuel in the Old Testament of the Bible about the Plague of Ashdod. According to 1 Samuel 5:6,7 in the NIV: ""Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity, ravaging them and afflicting them with tumors. And when the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay here with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon our god Dagon.” Poussin himself called this art piece; ""II miraculo dell'Arca nel tempio di Agon,"" meaning The Miracle of the Ark in the Temple of Dagon. This name refers to the temple of Dagon, which was destroyed in battle. Sheila Barker has written that this same battle in which the Ark of the Covenant was taken in this Biblical narrative.[3][2] The theft of this Ark was believed to have unleashed God's wrath and started the plague.[4][3]

One interpretation of the story of Plague of Ashdod stems from a story of the stolen Ark of the Covenant by Philistines during battle.[3] Because this Ark had been stolen, it was believed that plagues sent by the Judaeo-Christian God ravaged the city, riddling the people with disease and death.[3]  The purpose of these plagues would be a punishment and cause for the Ark of the Covenant to be returned to the Hebrews from whom it was stolen. Poussin depicts rats throughout the painting running around the bodies of the living and the dead. According to Asensi; when the Philistines sent the Ark of the Covenant back to the Hebrew people, it was sent with a ""guilt offering"" consisting of five gold rats and five gold tumors.[3]

Paintings depicting the plague are rare because, during the seventeenth century, a common belief was that viewing something such as a plague in art would have detrimental physical repercussions. It was believed that one would manifest what they were viewing and would literally come down with an epidemic such as the plague itself.[4] So strong were these widely accepted beliefs, that this caused images of disease to be very unpopular. Poussin's depictions of the people gesturing to cover their noses show his belief at the time that the breath of plague victims could have been contagious, or possibly the fact that the stench coming from the dying and diseased people was so bad that others had to cover their noses in order to avoid the stench.[2]

Plague figures that seem to be portrayed accurately are the hungry baby being pulled away from his dead mother's breasts, so that the baby would not become infected with the plague from the blood and milk of the mother. These images are particularly disturbing because people at this time would have been comforted by seeing the Madonna feeding her suckling baby, a symbol of life and safety for Catholics and Christians. To see this baby torn away from the infected mother seems almost inhumane.[2] Pestilence could then be seen as unprotected by the Madonna and as life threatening.[2] The man saving the child is risking his own life by doing so, which shows the courageousness of this figure. Poussin may have put this figure there to amplify the deep anger the viewer was meant to feel when viewing parts of the Plague of Ashdod.[2] One problematic figure in this painting is at the bottom of the statue of Dagon: there is a large relief that has yet to be interpreted.[2] There is also a woman carrying a toddler to the right of the Ark being watched by another man, who has also not been identified. The identification of the group of men that accompany the staring man is also unknown. According to Boeckl, these figures do not directly relate to the Biblical passage about the Plague of Ashdod, so these figures must be portrayals of Poussin's own interpretation of the epidemic.[2]

In 1630, during the same time that Poussin was commissioned to paint this piece, by Fabrizio Valguarnera, Fabrizio was having an exact replica made before the first was even completed. This commission was given to Angelo Caroselli. Valguarnera's reasons for ordering this commission have been questioned. Ann Sutherland Harris writes that the London version of The Plague of Ashdod was used by Fabrizio Valguarnera to launder money from stolen jewels.[1] According to Sheila Baker, Fabriozo Valguarnera was indeed seeking to launder his money through paintings when he visited Poussin's workshop in 1631.[2] This was when he first purchased two paintings by Poussin, one of which was The Plague of Ashdod.

A first engraving of the painting was made as early as 1631 by Jean Baron ón the basis of an intermediary drawing made by Guillaume Courtois.[5] This is one of the few engravings made in Rome during Poussin's lifetime. André Félibien had another engraving made in 1677 by Étienne Picart.

Edgar Degas and Paul Cézanne made partial drawings after the painting.

Various artists were inspired by the painting to create depictions of the same subject, borrowing liberally from Poussin's imagery. The Flemish painter Michiel Sweerts is the author of a painting with a similar subject painted around 1652-1654 that was once attributed to Poussin.[6] Sweerts' monumental Plague in an Ancient City (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) is regarded as his most ambitious work in terms not only of compositional complexity and technical achievement, but also of historical and archeological erudition. The composition depicts a haunting, dramatic vision of the ravages of the bubonic plague in a classical setting.  It was clearly an attempt by the artist to prove his talent, both in the depiction of a historical scene of epic proportions that encompasses a broad range of emotional and in the depiction of psychological states, following the grand classicizing style of his older French contemporary and fellow-resident in Rome, Poussin.[7]

Another Flemish painter, Peter van Halen painted in 1661 the Plague of the Philistines at Ashdod (signed and dated 1661, Wellcome Library), which was inspired by Poussin's treatment of the same subject, which he may have known through an etching.  He used in his composition the temple architecture and figures from the composition of Poussin as well as some figures derived from works by Rubens.[8]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2974978,"The Port of Boulogne by Moonlight or Moonlight over the Port of Boulogne (French - Le Clair de lune sur le port de Boulogne)  is an 1868 work by Édouard Manet. The work is now in the Musée d'Orsay.[1]

Historical and astronomical research has demonstrated that it was produced about midnight on the night of 3–4 August 1868 from a window of the Hôtel Folkestone on the quay at Boulogne-sur-Mer during one of the artist's regular summer stays in the town.[2] It shows a fishing boat returning at night, watched by the fishermen's wives. Its shadows and light pay tribute to the work of Rembrandt.[3]

Before the rise of the Côte d'Azur, the Parisian elite often spent their summers on the coast of the Channel. For example, Manet, who came from a wealthy family, stayed several times in Boulogne, where he painted many seascapes. In 1868 or 1869 the painter stayed at the Hôtel Folkestone, which overlooked the harbour. This is where Moonshine emerged over the port of Boulogne, which Manet later elaborated in his studio. Although the painting is often dated to 1869, 1868 is more likely, as the work was already on display at an exhibition in Brussels at the beginning of the summer of 1869.

The painting can be seen as a tribute to Dutch landscape painting and in particular to Aert van der Neer. Manet owned a work by this painter, who specialized in night scenes. However, Manet's casual painting style is far removed from Van der Neer's precise technique.

Moonshine over the port of Boulogne has a somewhat mysterious aura. The moonlight shines over a forest of masts and sails in the harbor. On the quay, a group of seven women in traditional costumes close together awaits the return of the fishing boats. Closer to the water's edge, a few men are still in the shade.

The Hanged Man's House was presented at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 and was the first painting that Cézanne sold to a collector. The village depicted in the painting is Auvers-sur-Oise, 27 km north of Paris.[1][2][3]

The Hanged Man's House is an oil painting on canvas that measures 55 cm x 66 cm and is signed by Cézanne on the bottom left in red paint. It displays a landscape with a complicated composition. The scene presents an atmosphere of solitude, due to the absence of people and the use of a cool colour palette. From the central point of the painting, there are several axis, including two paths leading to the centre and to the left, a bank on the right and the branches of a tree leading to the top of the painting. Cézanne had been heavily influenced by his friend  Camille Pissarro and as a result, used grainy, broken brushstrokes and pale colours used by the Impressionists.[2] In this composition, Cézanne challenged the conventions of art by making deliberate imperfections of perspective. The inaccuracies can be seen in the angle of the path that leads to the left and the bank on the right.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3221619,"The Battle Between Love and Chastity is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Pietro Perugino, now in the Musée du Louvre, in Paris, France. It was originally commissioned for the studiolo (cabinet) of Isabella d'Este, Marchesa of Mantua,  in the Castello di San Giorgio.

The painting was the third commissioned by Isabella d'Este for her studiolo, after the two canvasses by Andrea Mantegna, the Parnassus and the Triumph of the Virtues. The paintings of the Coronation of Isabella d'Este and Reign of Comus would be completed by Lorenzo Costa.

The subject was suggested by Isabella's court poet, Paride da Ceresara, documented by the correspondence between Isabella and Perugino, who was then active in Florence. The notary contract included all the details about the literary theme, as well as a drawing which the work had to be based on. For example, when Perugino painted a naked Venus, instead than dressed, the marchesa protested vigorously. 

In 1505, when the painting was delivered, the marchesa was not entirely satisfied. She declared that she preferred it would have been painted in oil, instead of the tempera used under her directives in order to follow Mantegna's style. Perugino, who probably was not at ease with the small format of the work, received 100 ducats for the work.

After the extinction of the Gonzaga dynasty, the painting was gifted by Charles I of Nevers to cardinal Richelieu, and was thus moved to Paris. Later it was acquired by the state and was added to the collection of the Louvre.

The painting, over a background with gently steeped hills, portrays a fight between the symbolic figures of Love and Chastity. The theme was similar to other commissioned for the studiolo. Among the numerous mythological figures are Minerva, Diana, Venus, Anteros, nymphs, fauns and others. In the background are depicted several mythological episodes showing the victory of Chastity over Carnal Love, such as Apollo and Daphne, Jupiter and Europa, Mercury and Glaucera, Polyphemus and Galatea, Pluto and Proserpina, and Neptune with the nymph transforming into a carrion crow.

The painting and its companion piece, A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts, originally decorated the walls of Villa Lemmi, a country villa near Florence owned by Giovanni Tornabuoni, uncle of Lorenzo de' Medici and head of the Roman branch of the Medici Bank. They were probably commissioned for the wedding in 1486 of Giovanni's son Lorenzo to Giovanna of the Albizzi family, and are therefore thought to depict the two.[1]

Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman shows a young woman, probably Giovanna Tornabuoni, being received by Venus and the three Graces. Giovanna holds open a white cloth, into which Venus is laying roses symbolizing beauty and love.[1]

Both paintings were discovered at Villa Lemmi in 1873 under a coat of whitewash and removed from the wall and transferred to a canvas support.  They are now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.[2]

Its inventory number is 171.[2] Art historians are uncertain about the dating of the painting, and propositions have ranged from 1470 to 1491.[1]

Its commissioner is unknown but the work relates to the Nativity panel in the predella of the Ottoni Altarpiece in Matelica. Its attribution has varied - in 1896 Charles Loeser argued it was a fake and Drey wrote of its artist as an elusive ""Master of the Adoration of Strasbourg"", but it is now held to be a late completely autograph work by Crivelli. Zampetti refers to it as ""a small masterpiece"".[3]

Bethlehem is shown in the work's background, possibly modelled on Ascoli Piceno, with the addition of a column with a gilded statue, one of the most noted ancient monuments of Constantinople. The perspectivally foreshortened Christ Child leans on a corner of the Madonna's mantle in a manner reminiscent of Mantegna's Ovetari Chapel frescoes.

It was commissioned on 16 February 1452 by the procureurs of the Augustinian monastery for Pierre Cadard, in honour of his father, the doctor Jean Cadard (1377-1449). Jean had been counsellor to Charles VII of France, and went into exile in the Comtat Venaissin after being accused of having John the Fearless assassinated in 1419. It was intended as the altarpiece for the chapel of Saint Pierre of Luxembourg, which Jean Cadard had had built for the Église des Célestins in Avignon. 

The contract for the painting included a predella but did not specify its subject. It is now lost, but according to tradition it showed Christ surrounded by the Twelve Apostles. An upper panel is also now lost.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q428985,"The Corner of the Table  is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Henri Fantin-Latour, created in 1872. It was exhibited at the 1872 Salon. It is held at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris.[1]

This painting was the third in a series of four “group portraits” created by the artist. The first two, Homage to Delacroix (1864) and A Studio at Les Batignolles (1870), reunited the painters that he admired; the fourth, Autour du Piano (1885), brought together the musicians.

Fantin-Latour's initial project was to create a painting where he would pay tribute to the poet Charles Baudelaire, in a similar way to what he had done to the painter Eugène Delacroix in a previous painting in 1864. He planned to bring together several personalities from the literary world around a portrait of the poet of Les Fleurs du Mal, at the occasion of his 50th birthday. It was his friend Edmond Maître who helped Fantin-Latour to contact several renowned poets, among them Albert Mérat, Paul Verlaine, and Arthur Rimbaud. Baudelaire's editor, Poulet-Malassis even had the idea to invite Leconte de Lisle, Théodore de Banville, and even Victor Hugo, but these personalities refused to pose. There are two sketches of this painting that Fantin-Latour had titled Le Repas.[2][3]

This group portrait therefore presents the poets that attended the dinners held at the Vilains Bonshommes, which Edmond Maître had presented to Fantin-Latour. Absent is Albert Mérat, who refused to pose with Rimbaud after an incident that occurred during the dinner of March 2, 1872, when the young poet allegedely interrupted a reading of Jean Aicard and forced the poets to take him out by force.

The group is depicted at the end of a meal, around a table. The painting shows, seated, from left to right, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Léon Valade, Ernest d'Hervilly, and Camille Pelletan. Standing, from left to right, there are Pierre Elzéar, Émile Blémont, and Jean Aicard. A vase with flowers, in the foreground, at the right, stands for the absent poet, Albert Mérat.[4][5]

In the foreground, on a white tablecloth at the edge of a table, are a fruit bowl, a carafe filled with wine and a bouquet of flowers on the right, another almost empty carafe on the left, scattered small colored fruits, a coffee cup, its saucer and its spoon. In the background, the group of characters, five of whom are seated and three standing, stand out with their black clothes, except for the one on the right in gray, and their detailed faces. They are placed against the gray background of the decor, occupied by a corner with two walls where two framed paintings are hung; the one on the right is seen from the front, and the one on the left is seen incompletely and from the side; the flowering branches of a plant occupy the top of the corner of the walls and hide the edge.

The characters adopt various poses: a long pipe in one hand; holding an open book; the hand in the waistcoat, above a pocket watch; in profile, wearing a top hat; the chin resting in one hand at the end of a leaning arm; disheveled hair, the right hand holding an empty glass; arms crossed... All the people depicted in the painting are dressed in black except for Camille Pelletan who is in grey.

Fantin-Latour's portrait of Rimbaud is, along with the photo taken by Étienne Carjat, the most famous and reproduced representation of the poet.[6]

The painting was sold to the English market, and then bought back by Émile Blémont, who donated it to the Louvre in 1910.[7] Since 1986, it is held at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris.[8]

The painting was the subject of a fictionalized story by Claude Chevreuil, Un Coin de Table (2010).

It was chosen by Michel Butor for his book Le Musée imaginaire de Michel Butor: 105 œuvres décisives de la peinture occidentale (2019), selecting a group of 105 ""decisive works"" of the western painting.[9]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1978815,"Grande Odalisque, also known as Une Odalisque or La Grande Odalisque, is an oil painting of 1814 by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres depicting an odalisque, or concubine. Ingres' contemporaries considered the work to signify Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism.

Grande Odalisque attracted wide criticism when it was first shown. It is renowned for the elongated proportions and lack of anatomical realism. The work is owned by the Louvre Museum, Paris which purchased the work in 1899.

The painting was commissioned by Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples,[1] and finished in 1814.[2] Ingres drew upon works such as Dresden Venus by Giorgione, and Titian's Venus of Urbino as inspiration for his reclining nude figure, though the actual pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder is directly drawn from the 1800 Portrait of Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David.

Ingres portrays a concubine in languid pose as seen from behind with distorted proportions. The small head, elongated limbs, and cool color scheme all reveal influences from Mannerists such as Parmigianino,[3] whose Madonna with the Long Neck was also famous for anatomical distortion.

This eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Critics viewed Ingres as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, one critic remarked that the work had ""neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation"".[4] This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism.[5] Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant, even light to tone down the volume.[5] Ingres continued to be criticized for his work until the mid-1820s.[3]

Stemming from the initial criticism the painting received, the figure in Grande Odalisque is thought to be drawn with ""two or three vertebrae too many.""[1][6] Critics at the time believed the elongations to be errors on the part of Ingres, but recent studies show the elongations to have been deliberate distortions.[7] Measurements taken on the proportions of real women showed that Ingres's figure was drawn with a curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to replicate.[6] It also showed the left arm of the odalisque is shorter than the right. The study concluded that the figure was longer by five instead of two or three vertebrae and that the excess affected the lengths of the pelvis and lower back instead of merely the lumbar region.[6]

Another interpretation of this painting suggests that since the duty of some concubines was merely to satisfy the carnal pleasures of the sultan, this elongation of her pelvic area may have been a symbolic distortion by Ingres. While this may represent sensuous feminine beauty, her gaze, on the other hand, has been said to ""[reflect] a complex psychological make-up"" or ""[betray] no feeling"". In addition, the distance between her gaze and her pelvic region may be a physical representation of the depth of thought and complex emotions of a woman's thoughts and feelings.[6]

French painter Jules Flandrin made a copy of La Grande Odalisque in 1903 which is exhibited at the Ingres Museum in Montauban, France.

In 1964, French artist Martial Raysse, in his series Made in Japan,[8] reframed La Grande Odalisque to make a portrait in the style of American pop art. This pastiche, through the inclusion of junk jewelry, relegates The Odalisque to the rank of a consumer product. 

In 1985, peruvian painter Herman Braun-Vega brought La Grande Odalisque in the middle of the country. In the shade of trees, she finds herself offered to the curiosity of Peruvian children. The title of this painting Pourquoi pas eux?(Why not them?)[9] indicates that this is an advocacy for the popularization of culture (""This boy who touches the knee of Ingres's nude, touches Western culture even if he is not aware of it."" Herman Braun-Vega[10]). In 2010, he did it again with his painting La ronde au crépuscule au bord du pacifique,[11] where La Grande Odalisque is relocated to the seaside, featuring, in addition to characters from Peruvian daily reality, nudes by Matisse and Picasso. 

La Grande Odalisque was appropriated by the feminist art group Guerrilla Girls for their first color poster and most iconic image. The 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster gave Ingres's odalisque a gorilla mask and posed the question ""Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?"". The poster used data from the group's first ""weenie count"" and drew attention to the overwhelming number of female nudes counted in the Modern Art sections of The Met. The poster was rejected by the Public Art Fund in New York and was run in advertising space on New York City buses until the bus company cancelled the lease arguing that the image was ""too suggestive and that the figure appeared to have more than a fan in her hand.""[12][13] La Grande Odalisque is also referenced in the lyrics to ""Pretension/Repulsion"" by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers from their 2009 album Journal for Plague Lovers. The songs lyrics were written by the band's former lyricist Richey Edwards before his disappearance in 1995. According to the Manics' vocalist, James Dean Bradfield, the song's lyrics deal with ""the idealisation of beauty, or what is ugliness"".

The Dream of Ossian (French: Le Songe d'Ossian) is an 1813 painting by the French artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. The work depicts the legendary poet Ossian sleeping while he dreams of relatives, warriors, and maidens, which appear above him on the canvas. Ingres was influenced by his contemporaries' Ossianic works, including James Macpherson's purported translations of Ossian's poems, François Gérard's 1801 painting Ossian Evoking Phantoms, and Jean-François Le Sueur's 1803 opera Ossian, ou Les bardes.

The painting was intended for the French emperor Napoleon's bedroom in the Quirinal Palace in Rome, but was reacquired by Ingres in 1835. Unfinished compositional adjustments were made to the painting, and the work was bequeathed to the Musée Ingres at the artist's death in 1867. Though subsequent criticism described the work as ""grisaille"" and ""bizarre"", others viewed the painting as characteristic of Neoclassicism or Romanticism.

Ossian is seated in the center foreground, dreaming while leaning on his harp. The poet is accompanied in the rocky landscape by a hound. The figures above Ossian are ghosts of the past and are part of his titular dream.[2][3] The vision is framed on the right by Ossian's son Oscar bearing a spear and shield[1] and on the left by a seated woman who holds a bow with one hand and extends the other towards Ossian. This figure has been interpreted by some to be Ossian's wife Evirallina[1][4] and by others to be Oscar's wife Malvina.[2][3] Behind this female figure is Ossian's father, Fingal, who leads a group of warriors, some of whom are embraced by naked women. In the center of the dream, four maidens play harps in the clouds before a seated and long-haired Snow King Starno.[4][5]

The literary source of the painting's scene can be found in a passage in The War of Inisthona from James Macpherson's Poems of Ossian. The passage relates how Malvina's harp charms Ossian to sleep, during which he dreams of the past.[3] The dreaming scene is also featured in Act IV, scene iii of the opera Ossian, ou Les bardes (English: Ossian, or The Bards), which contains descriptions of the armed warriors and their lovers that are likewise found in the painting.[6] The inclusion of four harpists in the painting is another possible reference to the opera.[4]

Ingres himself recorded the following about the scene's subject:

Ireland was the theater. On the last of Fingal's exploits, he solemnly consigned to Ossian his lance which had served him for the defense of the weak and oppressed. Then, deprived of his father and of his son Oscar, [who was] slain treacherously, blind and sick, he [Ossian] charmed his unhappiness and his misery by chanting of the exploits of his friends. He often crawled along the tomb of his son and father and there plucked with his trembling fingertips. The wife of dear Oscar, Malvina, never abandoned him; it was to her that he addressed the majority of his poems about the valiant Oscar ...[7]
Beneath this, Ingres added some notes for the painting:

victory of Fingal over Caracalla / Noise of the torrential storm / ground, heather and deserted lands / Brilliant stars / the baying of hounds.[7]
The painting's subject Ossian purportedly was a blind Scottish poet who lived in the 3rd century CE. In the 1760s, James Macpherson published texts supposedly by Ossian, which Macpherson claimed to have rediscovered and translated from Gaelic into English.[8][9] The translated works' success in Britain was followed by a spread of enthusiasm for Ossian throughout Europe. One of the poems was translated into French as early as 1762, and the collected works were translated in 1777. It was the Italian translation, however, by Melchiorre Cesarotti which the future French emperor Napoleon read.[10] Napoleon became a fervent admirer of Ossian; it was even said that he carried a copy of Ossian's work into battle.[4]

Though French artists turned to Ossian relatively late compared to the rest of Europe, Napoleon's patronage became a major incentive for many Ossianic works.[11] In 1800, Napoleon commanded architects Charles Percier and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine to decorate his summer residence Château de Malmaison. In 1801, Percier and Fontaine in turn commissioned paintings from François Gérard and Anne-Louis Girodet, who both turned to Ossian as the subject for their paintings.[12][13][14] Napoleon was also the dedicatee of the 1803 opera Ossian, ou Les bardes by Jean-François Le Sueur, and he attended the 1804 premiere.[4][7]

Like Napoleon, Ingres was an admirer of Ossian,[15] having made a drawing of The Dream of Ossian in 1809 while studying at the French Academy in Rome. Sometime between 1810 and 1812, Ingres was commissioned by the French Governor of Rome Miollis to create two large paintings for the formerly papal Quirinal Palace.[16][17][18] One was intended for the empress Marie Louise's sitting room and the other was for the ceiling of emperor Napoleon's bedroom. For the former, Ingres painted Romulus' Victory Over Acron (French: Romulus vainqueur d’Acron) in 1812.[19] For the latter, he completed The Dream of Ossian in 1813 on a canvas which was then affixed to the bedroom ceiling.[5][20] The artist found inspiration in Gérard's 1801 painting Ossian Evoking Phantoms (French: Ossian évoque les fantômes) that was commissioned for Malmaison.[13][21] Ingres was known to have had lithographs of Gérard's painting and had made sketches of its details.[4] Some compositional choices may have also been influenced by the opera Ossian, ou Les bardes by Le Sueur,[4] whom Ingres knew. Prior to completing The Dream of Ossian, Ingres had likely seen Le Sueur's opera, which was frequently performed between 1806 and 1811.[16] Additionally, it has been posited that Ingres's figures and outline technique in studies for the painting were drawn from British artist John Flaxman's 1792 illustration The Council of the Gods.[22][23]

Ingres made various versions of The Dream of Ossian,[6] both before and after completing his 1813 painting. As of 1983, there were 9 existing drawings on the subject by Ingres.[5] In 2021, these included an 1811 work in pencil and chalk in the Scottish National Gallery[24] and a c. 1832–1834 watercolor drawing in the Harvard Art Museums.[25]

Napoleon never used the bedroom for which The Dream of Ossian was intended. Following Napoleon's fall and around the time of disastrous French defeats in Italy,[18] the painting was removed from the Quirinal Palace in 1815 and was likely sold.[16] Ingres bought the painting back in 1835, with the intent of restoring it from its poor condition and possibly reselling the work. The painting was originally oval-shaped, but Ingres fitted it to a rectangular frame after repurchasing the work. He made several preparatory studies modifying the composition to its new frame before charging his pupil Raymond Balze with sketching in the changes. However, Balze's work was never completed, leaving some figures that appear to be doubled (such as the warrior with the lance on the left).[16][20] Ingres bequeathed The Dream of Ossian to the Museum of Montauban (now the Musée Ingres) at his death in January 1867.[26]

The Dream of Ossian is considered a history painting, a genre to which the young Ingres desired to devote his career. Ossian offered a departure from the Greco-Roman Classicism,[4][20] which dominated French art of the early 1800s.[14] Yet, there are some reservations to the work's characterization as an anticlassicist history painting. The historical authenticity of Ossian was the subject of a contemporary debate,[27] and the composition still features classical aspects such as the near-Roman style of armor worn by the warriors.[2]

Scholars have drawn a number of connections between Ingres's The Dream of Ossian and Gérard's Ossian Evoking Phantoms. The art historian Robert Rosenblum even notes that the former is ""clearly indebted"" to the latter.[13] In both Ingres's and Gérard's paintings, Ossian evokes ghosts and memories of the past which tower over him. There is also a potential parallel between Malvina (or Evirallina) in Ingres's depiction and the ghost of an old bard in Gérard's, since both figures are seen reaching out towards Ossian. Other similarities include the poet's dress, the harpists, and the embracing lovers. Conversely, there are also multiple contrasting elements. Gérard's Ossian calls for the ghosts willfully while Ingres's Ossian only dreams about them. Furthermore, the art writer Henry Okun described Gérard's painting as a ""romantic frenzy"", with movement present in the blowing winds and flowing stream; Ingres's painting by contrast was said to be ""replete with neoclassic calm"", featuring clouds and ghosts that have a ""cement-like consistency"".[2]

In 1952, the art editor Thomas B. Hess saw The Dream of Ossian as ""[having] all the emotional tone and sobbing fury that characterized the later appearance of Romantic painting.""[28] In her 1968 article on an Ingres exhibition at the Petit Palais, the English art historian Anita Brookner did not view the painting favorably. She described the depiction of the dream as ""grisaille"" and the painting as an Ingres work that must be ""written off"".[29] In 2018, the anthropologist Peter Gow wrote that the work was an ""extremely strange painting.""[30] He explained, ""The young Ingres who painted The Dream of Ossian is either bizarrely reactionary or bizarrely prophetic. You don't know if it is simply a bad painting, harking back to the worst excesses of the Baroque, or a sort of precocious fumbling towards Cubism or even German Expressionist cinema.""[20]

The Quai Saint-Michel and Notre-Dame is a 1901 oil on canvas painting by the French artist Maximilien Luce. Luce was part of the Neo-Impressionist movement between 1887 and 1897 and used the technique of employing separate dabs of color (divisionism), for the painting, which was one of ten he undertook of Notre Dame de Paris. The Musée d'Orsay in Paris, which holds the image as of 2015[update], notes that this was painted by Luce when he was moving from his Neo-Impressionist period to his later Populist period.[1] The Musée d'Orsay obtained the picture in 1981.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q783215,"Saint John the Baptist is a High Renaissance oil painting on walnut wood by Leonardo da Vinci. Likely to have been completed between 1513 and 1516, it is believed to be his final painting. Its original size was 69 by 57 centimetres (27 in × 22 in).

The painting is in the collection of the Louvre. In November 2022, it was loaned to Louvre Abu Dhabi for two years as part of the museum's fifth anniversary.[1]

The work depicts the figure of John the Baptist in isolation through the use of chiaroscuro, with the figure appearing to emerge from the shadowy background. The saint is dressed in furs, has long curly hair and is smiling in an enigmatic manner reminiscent of Leonardo's famous Mona Lisa. He holds a reed cross in his left hand, while his right hand points up toward heaven, similar to the figure of Saint Anne in Leonardo's Burlington House Cartoon. According to Frank Zöllner, Leonardo's use of sfumato ""conveys the religious content of the picture"", with the ""gentle shadows [imbuing] the subject's skin tones with a very soft, delicate appearance, almost androgynous in its effect"".[2]

Kenneth Clark claimed that for Leonardo, Saint John represented ""the eternal question mark, the enigma of creation"", and noted the sense of ""uneasiness"" that the painting imbues.[3] Barolsky adds that: ""Describing Saint John emerging from the darkness in almost shockingly immediate relation to the beholder, Leonardo magnifies the very ambiguity between spirit and flesh. The grace of Leonardo's figure, which has a disturbingly erotic charge, nonetheless conveys a spiritual meaning to which Saint John refers when he speaks of the fullness of grace from God.""[4]

The model for the John the Baptist / Bacchus / Angelo incarnato series was Salaì.[5]

The dating of Saint John the Baptist is disputed.[6] It was seen by Antonio de Beatis in Leonardo's workshop at Clos Lucé;[7] his diary entry giving a terminus ante quem of 17 October 1517.

Traditionally, the painting has been considered the artist's last, and has been dated to 1513–1516; Leonardo's sfumato technique here being considered to have reached its apogee.[6] Some experts, however, have compared the hand of Saint John to a similar work by a pupil in the Codex Atlanticus, dating the commencement of the picture to around 1509.[6] The pose is also similar to that of a sculpture of the same subject completed after 1510 for the Florence Baptistery by Giovanni Francesco Rustici.[8] Leonardo is thought to have given Rustici technical advice for his commission; it is possible that one artist could have influenced the other with the idea for the pose.[9]

Saint John the Baptist was apparently part of the French king Francis I's collection at Fontainebleau in 1542. In 1625, King Charles I of England received the painting from Louis XIII of France in return for a Titian – the Holy Family – and Hans Holbein's Portrait of Erasmus.[6] In 1649, Charles's collection was sold, whereupon the painting entered into the hands of the banker Eberhard Jabach.[6] After a spell in the possession of Cardinal Mazarin, in 1661 the work once again returned to the King of France – Louis XIV. Following the French Revolution, the painting entered the collection at the Louvre, where it remains to this day.[6]

Prior to this work, Saint John had traditionally been portrayed as a gaunt ascetic. Leonardo's innovative depiction proved influential upon Raphael's workshop; several portraits of Saint John painted around 1517–1518 attributed to Raphael and Giulio Romano show a similarly youthful saint in isolation, with a strong contrast between the dark background and the illumination of the figure.[10]

Also numerous copies and variations of Saint John the Baptist made by Leonardeschi exist.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18224327,"Pietà with Saint Francis and Saint Mary Magdalene is a 1602-1607 oil on canvas painting by Annibale Carraci. Now in the Louvre, it was looted from the Mattei family chapel in San Francesco a Ripa in Rome by Napoleon's troops in 1797 and was not returned at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.[1]

It is thought to be the work referred to in a letter by Giovanni Battista Agucchi reproduced in Carlo Cesare Malvasia's Felsina Pittrice – other references in Malvasia date the letter to 1607.[2] Agucchi's words suggest he was referring to a recent work by Annibal and – though the letter does not refer explicitly to the work now in the Louvre – the context suggests that the Louvre work is the only one to which Agucchi could be referring.[3] A second undated letter by Agucchi explicitly refers to the Pietà in the Mattei chapel, whilst another passage in Felsina confirms that that Pietà was one of Carracci's last works but states that others had dated the work much earlier.

Tietze, Mahon, Cavalli and Posner have all argued that 1607 is much too late a date for the work.[2] However, a 1603 Domenichino copy of the work on copper backs a date very close to Carracci's death or at least just before Domenichino made the copy, although it seems to disprove the 1607 date in Agucchi's letter.[2][4] It replaces Francis of Assisi with Joseph of Arimathea, perhaps suggesting that Carracci originally painted Joseph but modified it to Francis once he had a definite location for the work, namely in a church dedicated to Francis, and that Domenichino made the copy before Carraci made the modification.[2] A preparatory drawing by Annibale (now in the Jenisch Museum in Vevey) with Joseph but without Francis was thought to confirm this theory until a 1994 X-ray of the Louvre work showed the absence of pentimenti.[2] Another theory suggests that the area now occupied by Francis was blank when the copy was made, with Domenichino adding a figure of Joseph (either from his own invention or from rejected preparatory drawings by Annibale) and with Annibale later filling the blank with a figure of Francis[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3206488,"The Battle of Aboukir is an oil-on-canvas painting executed in 1806 by the French artist Antoine-Jean Gros. It has the large dimensions of 578 by 968 cm. It is held at the Palace of Versailles.

The painting depicts the battle of Aboukir that took place on 25 July 1799, when the outnumbered French Army led by Napoleon was able to defeat the Ottoman Empire Army and their British allies in Egypt. At the center of the composition is the French general Joachim Murat, riding a white horse and holding high his sword, in a scene of bloody carnage near the sea. To his right, the Turkish pasha presents him with his sword as a sign of surrendering. In the background are a fortress and some ships on the sea.[1]

The dramatism of the scene represents a radical departure of the way battles were depicted in neoclassical painting: it is already a romantic scene, and this and other paintings by Gros had a strong influence in the development of the work of fellow French painters Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix.[2]

The painting was commissioned from Gros by Joachim Murat, and executed in 1806. It was in the National Palace of Naples in 1808, and was bought by the Musée du Luxembourg in 1833. Since 1835 it is part of the art collection of the Palace of Versailles.[3] A small sketch for the painting is held at the Detroit Institute of Arts.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2734892,"Women in the Garden (French: Femmes au jardin) is an oil painting begun in 1866 by French artist Claude Monet when he was 26. It is a large work painted en plein air; the size of the canvas necessitated Monet painting its upper half with the canvas lowered into a trench he had dug, so that he could maintain a single point of view for the entire work. The setting is the garden of a property he was renting. His companion and future wife Camille Doncieux posed for the figures. Monet finished the work indoors, and used magazine illustrations to render fashionable clothing.

Monet at this time was early in his career, experimenting with method and subject matter. His earlier paintings were successful at Paris Salons, but Women in the Garden was rejected in 1867 on the grounds of subject and narrative weakness. The Salon was also troubled by Monet's heavy brushstrokes, a style which would, of course, become one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. A judge commented, ""Too many young people think of nothing but continuing in this abominable direction. It is high time to protect them and save art!""[1]  The painting was purchased by fellow artist Frédéric Bazille to help support Monet at a time when he had no money.[2]

Although the Musée d'Orsay, the painting's owner, comments that ""Monet has skilfully rendered the white of the dresses, anchoring them firmly in the structure of the composition"", Christoph Heinrich, author of a Monet biography, notes how posterity has found the painting lacking. In this view, the figures appear poorly integrated into the scene, with the woman at right ""gliding across the ground as if she had a trolley concealed beneath her dress"".[3] The painting's treatment of light and shadow is lauded, however, and in this respect the work may have shown Monet where his artistic path lay.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3207251,"The Snake Charmer (French: La Charmeuse de Serpents) is a 1907 oil-on-canvas painting by French Naïve artist Henri Rousseau (1844–1910). It is a depiction of a woman with glowing eyes playing a flute in the moonlight by the edge of a dark jungle with a snake extending toward her from a nearby tree.

The Snake Charmer was commissioned by Berthe, Comtesse de Delaunay, the mother of artist Robert Delaunay. It was Rousseau's first large commission and was exhibited in the 1907 Autumn Salon.[1][2] Because Rousseau never traveled outside of France, the exotic plants in the painting resulted from Rousseau's visits to the Jardin des plantes and from magazines.[3] From 1922 to 1936, The Snake Charmer was in the collection of Jacques Doucet. It was promised to the Louvre in 1925 and became part of its collection in 1937.[4][5]

The painting has an asymmetric vertical composition with a detailed depiction of the jungle on the right and a woman playing the flute on the left, back-lit by moonlight from a full moon. A snake, charmed by the music, stretches horizontally across the painting. The Musée d'Orsay described the painting as ""a black Eve in a disquieting Garden of Eden"".[4]

Sylvia Plath's 1957 poem ""Snakecharmer"" and Willard Elliot's 1975 composition The Snake Charmer for Alto Flute and Orchestra were inspired by Rousseau's painting.[6][7][8]

The painting inspired Australian artist Brett-Livingstone Strong's painting Homage to Henri Rousseau, which is recognisable as the album cover of the 1987 Fleetwood Mac album Tango in the Night. The painting was also used as cover art for the 2000 novel Merrick by Ann Rice, Darwin’s Dangerous idea by Daniel C. Dennett, Origins of the Modern Mind by Merlin Donald, and Gaia by James E.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47013750,"The Beakful, in French, La Becquée, or Woman Feeding Her Children is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Jean-François Millet, made in 1860. It is held at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille.

This canvas was the culmination of a long process that began with sketches and preparatory drawings made during 1848–1849.[1] Some of the drawings are also kept at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille.

A painted sketch of Woman Feeding Her Children, made in 1848, is held at the Ahmed Zabana National Museum, in Oran, Algeria. Acquired in the 1950s, it was stolen in 1985 and found in France in 2001. It was returned to the Algerian authorities in 2014.

A mother, squatting on a stool in front of her farmhouse door, gives soup to her three children seated on the threshold, while the father, in the background, digs his garden. In a letter addressed to the art critic Théophile Thoré-Burger, who saw the canvas exhibited in the Martinet Gallery, Millet explained: ""I would like [in this painting] to imagine a brood of birds being fed by their mother. Man works to feed these beings”.[2]

Millet sketched his models on the spot, but went back to his studio to paint. The comparison between the preparatory drawings, made long before, and the final painting, reveals a maturation of the painter's intentions in the composition of the canvas. If the theme itself is immediately present, the construction of the painted scene directs the viewer's towards the father who works the land, at the right. Although barely visible, it holds a central place in the encenation of the nourishing actions assigned to each of the parents. Everything then contributes to express family harmony, from the eyes and hands of the children brought together by the tenderness of the figures of their parents, their massive and protective mother, and their discreet and hardworking father, both united in their function, nurturing. The family harmony is further reinforced by the harmony of the play of colors and by the light that bathes the scene.[3]

In 1871, the painting was the property of Madame Maracci, a wealthy patron who wished to donate to the city of Lille a painting by Auguste-Joseph Herlin, then assistant to the curator of the city's painting museum. Herlin, embarrassed, dissuaded her, and convinced her to donate a work by another artist. This is how Millet's painting entered the museum.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3851966,"The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine (or Mystical) is  a painting by Correggio dating about the  mid-1520s currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris, France. 

The history of this picture can be traced right back to the beginning. Vasari mentions it as being in the house of a Modenese doctor, Francesco Grillenzoni; in 1582 Cardinal Luigi d'Este bought it, and presented it to Catarina Nobili Sforza, Countess of Santa Fiora and grand-niece of Pope Julius III. It was still in her possession in 1595.[1]

In 1614 the panel was in Rome, the property of Cardinal Sforza of Santa Fiora,[2] who had no doubt inherited it. It was subsequently owned by Scipione Borghese, and then by Cardinal Antonio Barberini; the latter gave it to Mazarin in c. 1650. Louis XIV bought it from Mazarin's heirs in 1661, for 15000 livres.[3]

Correggio first depicted this subject in another painting originally held in Naples (and not universally accepted as his work). The Louvre picture dates from the early 1520s, and it shows clear signs of Leonardo's influence (esp. lips, hands, visage), to which Correggio was particularly susceptible in his endeavour to convey a soft and graceful effect.

A number of replicas of this painting have been made, many of which still survive. It has often been a source of inspiration to artists: in the 19th century it was copied by Louis Gustave Ricard, and several times by Fantin-Latour.[4]

The people are gathered around a white picnic blanket, where food as fruits, cake or wine is located. The mood in this natural space is primarily created by the play of light and shadow, which originates by deciduous tree above them.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17496122,"Sailboats and Estuary (also The Entrance to the Port of Roscoff, French: L'entrée du port de Roscoff) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Belgian srtist Théo van Rysselberghe. Painted around 1887, it shows a coastal landscape elaborated in a Pointillist technique. Van Rysselberghe probably adopted the Pointillist manner after befriending Signac; however, the use of color in Sailboats and Esuary is nonetheless far more realistic than in paintings by Signac and other Neo-Impressionists, and reveals a tendency towards naturalism.[1] The artwork has been in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1982, on loan from the Louvre.[2]

Van Rysselberghe was one of the founders of the Brussels progressive association Les XX, and played a leading role in the communication between Belgian and French artists. He regularly traveled to Paris to meet fellow painters and to visit exhibitions.

When, in 1886, during the last major Impressionist exhibition Georges Seurat presented what would become the leading example of pointillist technique, namely A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Van Rysselberghe initially voiced reservations about it in an exchange of letters with his friend Emile Verhaeren.

In 1887, however, he was the one who arranged for the work to be shown in an exhibition of Les XX, along with six coastal landscapes that Seurat created in Grandcamp and Honfleur. One year later, Van Rysselberghe organized an exhibition in Brussels with Neo-Impressionist painters such as Paul Signac, Henri-Edmond Cross and Albert Dubois-Pillet. In the meantime he had also adopted the pointillist method himself, both in his portraits and landscapes. One of the earliest examples is the canvas he probably painted around 1887, or 1889, that is Sailboats and Estuary.

In the late 1880s, Van Rysselberghe painted a number of pointillist works on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany, which seem to have been inspired by the coastal views of Grandcamp and Honfleur realized by Seurat, whose waterscapes often draw the viewer in with a close-up view of land or a pier at the side of the canvas, and then give way to an expanse of ocean and sky separated by a thin wedge of land.[1] The work is unsigned and was in a private collection for a long time until 1982.[3]

Sailboats and Estuary is typical of both the theme and the neo-impressionist style that Van Rysselberghe had learned directly from the movement's leading artists: he started entirely from the theory of color as defined by Seurat, more specifically, his ""doctrine of simultaneous contrasts"", which he had studied extensively. He meticulously juxtaposes unmixed dark blue, crimson, yellow, green and white brushstrokes against each other in arithmetically determined proportions, as in a kind of mosaic. Ultimately this leads to an extremely balanced, tightly styled composition, with an almost classical rigor. In a synthetic way he allows the fragmented color keys to flow into a monochrome overall image, where the separate color keys blocks give an almost glittering effect. With this he achieves the maximum effect of the special light effect propagated by Seurat in his color theory, also referred to as luminism.

A reviewer of the Parisian art magazine La Plume wrote of the painting on April 1, 1898, ""it shows in all its facets the full luminous beauty that the new pointillist school can offer.""[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q656434,"La Belle Ferronnière (French pronunciation: ​[la bɛl fɛʁɔnjɛʁ]) is a portrait of a lady, usually attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, in the Louvre. It is also known as Portrait of an Unknown Woman. The painting's title, applied as early as the seventeenth century, identifying the sitter as the wife or daughter of an ironmonger (a ferronnier), was said to be discreetly alluding to a reputed  mistress of Francis I of France, married to a certain Le Ferron.  Later she was identified as Lucretia Crivelli, a married lady-in-waiting to Duchess Beatrice of Milan, who became another of the Duke's mistresses.[1]

Leonardo's Lady with an Ermine has also been known by this name. This was once believed to be a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, one of the mistresses of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan.[2] The narrative and the title were applied to Lady with an Ermine when it was in Princess Czartoryski's collection, and became confused with La Belle Ferronnière by the presence in this image also of a jewel worn on a delicate chain across the forehead, called a ferronnière. 

This painting was on loan in Louvre Abu Dhabi, UAE[3] in 2017.[4]

Although the model of the painting La Belle Ferronnière is still shrouded in mystery, the landmark exhibition ""Leonardo Da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan"" (National Gallery, London, 9 Nov. 2011 – 5 Feb. 2012) listed the portrait as possibly depicting Beatrice d'Este, wife of Ludovico Sforza.[5] This challenges an earlier identification of the sitter as Lucrezia Crivelli, a mistress of Ludovico.[6]

Karl Morgenstern (1813) and other critics noted some similarities with the drawing number 209 preserved in the Uffizi, executed in lapis and watercolor but retouched a little hard everywhere by a hand of the sixteenth century, which was identified by Father Sebastiano Resta (XVII century) as a portrait of Beatrice d'Este and attributed to Leonardo da Vinci . So also Dalli Regoli (1985), who considered the drawing the copy from a lost original by Leonardo.

Bernard Berenson attributed this portrait to Bernardino de' Conti.[7] Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio was suggested by Herbert Cook, who retracted his opinion, seeing Leonardo's own hand, in 1904.[8]

A later version of the painting, on canvas,[9] had been offered to the Kansas City Art Institute as the original, but was identified as a copy, on the basis of a photograph, by Sir Joseph Duveen, who permitted his remarks to be published in the New York World in 1920; the owner, Mrs Andrée Lardoux Hahn, sued for defamation of property in a notorious court case,[10] which involved many of the major connoisseurs of the day,[11] inspecting the two paintings side by side at the Louvre; the case was eventually heard in New York before a jury selected for not knowing anything of Leonardo or Morellian connoisseurship, and settled for $60,000 plus court expenses, which were considerable.[12][13] The owner's account, Harry Hahn's The Rape of La Belle (1946) is a classic of populist conspiracy theory applied to the art world.  After decades in an Omaha vault, the Hahn La Belle was sold at auction by Sotheby's on January 28, 2010 as ""by a follower of Leonardo, probably before 1750""; it brought $1.5 million, a price three times higher than Sotheby's pre-sale estimate.  The buyer was an unidentified American collector.[14][15]

A 19th-century copy of La Belle Ferronnière is conserved in the Musée des beaux-arts, Chambéry.[16] The Louvre painting is identified in pre-Revolutionary inventories of the French royal collection.[17]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1118456,"The Swing (French: La balançoire) is an 1876 oil on canvas painting by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir who was a leading exponent of the Impressionist style. The painting measures 92 x 73 centimetres and is in the Musée d’Orsay. Renoir executed the painting in what are now the Musée de Montmartre gardens. He had rented a cottage in the gardens so that he could be closer to the Moulin de la Galette where he was engaged in painting Bal du moulin de la Galette.

Renoir's people seem to stand on a forest floor of blossoms. The girl on the swing could be fifteen, her pink dress with a hat on head increases the charm of painting.[1] The quivering light is rendered by the patches of pale colour, particularly on the clothing and the ground. This particularly annoyed the critics when the painting was shown at the Salon of 1877.[2]

The model was Jeanne Samary, a favourite of Renoir's who appears in many of his paintings. The two men are Renoir's brother Edmond and a painter friend Norbert Goeneutte (also appearing in Bal).[3][4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q97622818,"Cyparissus is a 1620s Baroque painting on a mythological subject from Ovid's Metamorphoses by the Italian painter Jacopo Vignali. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France, to which it had been donated by the collectors Othon Kaufmann and François Schlageter in 1994. Its inventory number is 994-1-8,[2] or 44.994.1.8.[1]

The painting depicts the young Cyparissus, mourning his pet deer, that he had mistakenly killed with his own bow and arrow. The young boy's pain is amplified beyond the description given by Ovid, and possibly inspired by a 1624 Venetian edition of Giovanni Andrea dell' Anguillara's Metamorfosi ridotte in ottava rima, in which the tearful aspect of the story is emphasized.[1] It is one of the very few profane paintings by Vignali.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q97907782,"The Immaculate Conception with Saint Lawrence and Saint Francis of Paola is an oil on canvas altarpiece by the Italian Rococo painter Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 435.[2]

The painting depicts Mary, mother of Jesus as the Immaculata, appearing to Saint Lawrence, who gazes at her, and to Francis of Paola, who looks at the viewer while pointing his left hand towards the apparition. Owing to its flamboyant virtuosity and its expressiveness, the work has long been thought to have been painted by Giovanni Domenico's father, Giovanni Battista, but since 1939, it is accepted as an early masterpiece by the younger Tiepolo. On account of the stylistic resemblances with Giovanni Battista's paintings, it is thought that it was painted shortly after his death, i.e. 1770, when Giovanni Domenico was still carrying his father's mantle while beginning to develop his own, more realistic and even naturalistic style (here visible in the trompe-l'œil basket at the lower edge of the painting).[1]

The painting was bought in 1898 by Wilhelm von Bode from the Florentine art dealer Elia Volpi [it], and entered the collections in 1900. Between 1810 and 1879, it had belonged to the parish church of Cavenzano, Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta (Cavenzano) [it], now part of the commune of Campolongo Tapogliano, where it was replaced by a faithful copy. Before that, it had belonged to the Dominican monastery of Aiello del Friuli. But it is not documented if the altarpiece was painted for that institution or, for that matter, who commissioned it.[1][2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1713754,"Jupiter and Antiope (French: Jupiter et Antiope) is an oil painting by the French artist Antoine Watteau. It is also known as the Satyr and the Sleeping Nymph and was probably painted between 1714 and 1719. Intended to be placed over a doorway, today it hangs in the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

The painting is oval shaped, with a width of 107.5 cm and a height of 73 cm. In the foreground it depicts the naked, sleeping Antiope. She lies with her head on the left edge of the painting, twisted so that her front side faces the viewer. Her right arm is bent under her head while her left arm hangs down into the abyss in front of her. This arm covers the right breast, while the left remains free. Her legs are bent up towards the viewer, with the right continuing the line of her body at the knee while her left leg is only slightly bent to point back to the lower right of the painting. The whole body is painted in pale, warm colours and lights up the otherwise dark and earthy image. Under the sleeping woman there is a cloth, which hangs over the abyss near her breast, disappears under her arm near her head and is lifted by the satyr behind her.

The satyr, whose head is crowned with grape vines symbolising the presence of the god Bacchus. lies in the opposite direction behind the woman, with the front of his body also facing the viewer. With his left arm he lifts the cloth to the height of Antiope's shoulder and it is obvious that he has just uncovered the sleeping maiden. His left arm is bent on a tree root at the right edge of the image and props up his upper body. With his head and upper body, the satyr looms over the hips of the sleeper in order to gaze upon her – he licks his lips lustfully. His body is shadowy and cannot be made out below his hips. The satyr is depicted in brown tones. His suntanned skin and muscular body forms a clear contrast with the softly worked, shapely Antiope.

The lower edge of the image is taken up by an abyss, which is depicted in dark brown tones and is edged with bare soil. On either side, gnarled roots grow in the soil, which rise into indistinct trees. The ground continues above the trees into the background, where there is a hill with lone houses. Above that is the cloudy sky, discreetly lit by the glow of twilight.

The composition fits the oval shape of the image. The sleeping Antiope forms the central horizontal, with her hips and bent legs creating the central vertical. The arms of the satyr and the legs of the woman curve in parallel with the upper edge of the painting – in this way the two central characters repeat the oval within the image, which is broken only by dangling left arm of the woman. Spatial depth is created by the stooped posture of Jupiter and by the bent knees of Antiope.

The painting comes out of the story of the seduction of Antiope by the god Zeus in Greek mythology, later imported into Roman mythology and told of the god Jupiter. According to this myth, Antiope, the beautiful daughter of King Nycteus of Thebes, was surprised and seduced by Zeus in the form of a satyr. She became pregnant and bore the twins Amphion and Zethus, who later killed Nycteus' brother Lycus in revenge for his treatment of Antiope and took over the city of Thebes.

Satyrs and nymphs form two extremes in Greek mythology, which are united only by their instinctive natures. While the nymph was the source of the psychological term nymphomania (now hypersexuality), the satyr was the source of the once common but now outdated term satyriasis and can be understood as the nymph's male equivalent.

Accordingly, both nymphs and satyrs are very regularly depicted in mythology – and thence also in their subsequent artistic reception – in erotic contexts and are accordingly favoured topics of art. In addition there is a clear aesthetic contrast between the two stereotypes. The nymph is in general very beautiful and physically perfect. They were mostly depicted with ivory, light and very delicate colours and an idealised female form, having close similarities with depictions of Venus. On the other hand, the satyrs, who are the followers of Bacchus, are very ugly, with the horns, legs and sometimes the tail of a goat. They are also strong, muscular, and tanned. Thus nymphs and satyrs present an optical contrast, which could hardly be any stronger and which makes them a perfect pair for artistic purposes.[1]

The circumstances of the painting's creation are not entirely clear (see below). In the art historical literature, the assumption that the painting was created as a commission for the banker Pierre Crozat under the instruction of Watteau's teacher Charles de La Fosse around the time of the creation of the four Seasons prevails. La Fosse encouraged Watteau who had not practiced history painting hitherto to take on the work of the allegories of the Seasons, since he himself was not in the neighbourhood anymore. The Seasons seem to have been designed as oval paintings with mythological scenes intended to decorate Crozat's dining room.

In parallel with this series, Watteau produced a range of other paintings, which dealt with the theme of the mythological nude in this same oval format which was at that time unusual. At first he painted a number of historical images in the classical format, following Italian and Netherlandish classics, after which he next created Jupiter and Antiope, the seasons and three further seasons in the oval format: another Autumn, Venus Disarming Amor and the Morning Toilette.

Models for the painting of Jupiter and Antiope included the paintings of the same name by Antonio da Correggio and Titian as well as the Descent from the Cross of the Dutch painter Anthony van Dyck, from which the arrangement of the satyr's arms is taken.

During his preparation for the Jupiter and Antiope, at least three sketches were created by Watteau, in which he attempted to work the satyr out. These include a drawing of the satyr in kneeling position and one in the reclining pose which he finally selected. No sketches of Antiope are known, but Watteau had already produced a great number of female nudes and studies which he could draw on for this painting. Finally, an image now lost showed the whole image and was used by the engraver Anne-Claude-Philippe, Comte de Caylus as model for a copper engraving which was first published by Jules de Jullienne.

Watteau returned to the theme of the sleeping nymph in his 1719 painting The Elysian Fields, a scene of the gardens of the Champs-Élysées in Paris. Here he depicted a stone copy of Antiope wearing a crown as a monument on the pedestal at the right hand side of the painting, as a kind of ""living sculpture"" which is typical of Watteau.[2] This statue is placed directly above a gallantly dressed man seen only from behind (Hagestolz) who considers the scenery as part of a group of men in the foreground (Watteau also painted a similar group of people in the Rural Pleasure of 1720, in that case standing under a statue of Venus). According to Börsch-Supan, the Hagestolz represents the natural counterpoint to the lustful satyr - he observes the figure on the pedestal with particular interest.[3]

The history of the painting after its creation is not yet completely clear and in particular its location before 1857 remains an open question.

Probably Watteau painted the image as a commission for the merchant Pierre Crozat, for whom he also produced the series of Seasons painted at the same time. This is claimed in an exhibition catalogue from Vienna in 1966 and remains the most widely accepted theory in art history to this day, but it still cannot be proven.

In 1857 the painting appeared at the auction of the collection of Theodore Patureau in a catalogue in which it was listed as a former possession of Prince Paul d'Arenberg. Watteau maintained a friendly relationship with the ancestors of the prince in the early eighteenth century and a receipt of 14 May 1717 signed by Watteau records that he had sold two paintings to Léopold Philippe d'Arenberg. In their 1929 book Jean de Juliennes et les graveurs de Watteau au XVIIIe siècle E. Hérold and A. Vuaflart suggest that Jupiter and Antiope could have been one of these two paintings and develop a theory that de Ligne ordered the painting in 1714 during a trip to Paris and returned to collect the painting and pay for it three years later.[4] Today this theory is largely rejected.

How the painting came into the possession of Paturae is no longer clear either, but he probably bought it from Price Paul d'Arenberg privately. In 1864 the Baron James Mayer de Rothschild bought the painting and then put it up for auction again in March 1868 through the art-dealer Bourlon de Sarty. It was bought by Louis La Caze who died the very next year, leaving it to the Louvre. The painting still hangs there today.[5]

The conservation status of the painting is relatively poor. With the help of X-ray imaging cracked areas were restored, particularly in the sky and around the edges. Further investigations revealed that Antiope originally wore a cloth of modesty which was later removed. Whether the cloth and its subsequent removal were painted by Watteau himself is not clear. A later addition and removal is also possible. The X-ray imagery and especially Watteau's sketches and the copper engraving of Watteau's contemporary the Comte de Caylus confirm that the satyr was painted by Watteau, which was once controversial. The old theory that the final private owner, Louis La Caze had made alterations to the painting can also now be considered disproven.

After its creation Jupiter and Antiope was repeatedly copied and reworked. Two copies by an unknown artist are preserved in the Louvre in the Service d’Etudes et de Documentation.

The previously mentioned copper engraving of the Comte de Caylus was created in the lifetime of Watteau and was included in Jean de Jullienne's collection Figures de différents caractères.[6] He based his depiction not on the painting itself, but like most of his engravings on a drawing by Watteau which is now lost. A drawing of the painting by Gabriel de Saint-Aubin also existed which is today on display in the Art Institute of Chicago.

The French painter Lucien Lévy-Dhurmer painted an invented View of Watteau's Studio in 1890, in which the Jupiter and Antiope features as one of the paintings on the walls. Another painting in which the painting appears as part of the composition is the Salle La Caze painted by Édouard Vuillard in 1922. Ernest Laurent copied the image as a grisaille and a free modern interpretation was made by Claude Schurr in 1966.

Patrick Süskind's novel Perfume published by Diogenes Verlag since 1985 has a detail from Jupiter and Antiope on the cover with the armpit of the naked sleeper in the centre. This might symbolise the novel's central theme of fragrant seduction. The novel was an international best seller, translated into 49 languages, with over 20 million copies sold. The same image has been used on all versions of the cover except the American paperback edition (where it was prohibited to depict a women's nipple), thus the book has made Watteau's Antiope famous worldwide.

In July 1971 Paraguay produced a postage stamp with the motif of the sleeping nymph.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1216387,"The Lacemaker is a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675), completed around 1669–1670 and held in the Louvre, Paris. The work shows a young woman wearing a yellow bodice, holding up a pair of bobbins in her left hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow on which she is making her bobbin lace. 

At 24.5 cm × 21 cm (9.6 in × 8.3 in), the work is the smallest of Vermeer's paintings,[1] seen by one author as one of his most abstract and unusual.[2] The canvas used was cut from the same bolt as that used for A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, and both paintings seem to have had identical dimensions originally.[3][4]

The girl is set against a blank wall, probably because the artist sought to eliminate any external distractions from the central image. As with his The Astronomer (1668) and The Geographer (1669), it is likely that the artist undertook careful study before he executed the work; the art of lacemaking is portrayed closely and accurately.[5] Some believe Vermeer may have use a camera obscura while composing the work: many optical effects typical of projection can be seen, in particular the blurring of the foreground.[1] By rendering areas of the canvas as out-of-focus, Vermeer is able to suggest depth of field in a manner unusual of Dutch Baroque painting of the era[6] but common in his interior works starting as early as 1657 in ""Girl Reading a Letter by an Open Window"".

In The Lacemaker, the red and white of the lace is shown as spilling from the sewing cushion in a near liquid form,[2] contrasting sharply with the precision of the lace she is shown working on.[1]

According to the art historian Lawrence Gowing,

Vermeer's painting is often compared to a 1662 canvas by the Dutch portrait and genre painter Caspar Netscher, which is similarly contemplative in tone.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q775407,"The Balcony (French: Le balcon) is an 1868-69 oil painting by the French painter Édouard Manet. It depicts four figures on a balcony, one of whom is sitting: the painter Berthe Morisot, who married Manet's brother Eugène in 1874. In the centre is the painter Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemet.  On the right is Fanny Claus, a violinist.  The fourth figure, partially obscured in the interior's background, is possibly Léon Leenhoff, Manet's son.[1] It was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1869, and then kept by Manet until his death in 1883.  It was sold to the painter Gustave Caillebotte in 1884, who left it to the French state in 1894.  It is currently held at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris.

The painting, inspired by Majas on the Balcony by Francisco Goya, was created at the same time and with the same purpose as Luncheon in the Studio.

The three characters, who were all friends of Manet, seem to be disconnected from each other: while Berthe Morisot, on the left, looks like a romantic and inaccessible heroine, the young violinist Fanny Claus and the painter Antoine Guillemet seem to display indifference. The boy in the background is probably Manet's son, Léon. Just behind the railings, there are a hydrangea in a ceramic pot, and a dog with a ball below Morisot's chair.[2]

This was the first portrait of Morisot by Manet.  Manet adopts a restrained colour palette, dominated by white, green and black, with accents of blue (Guillemet's tie) and red (Morisot's fan).

Manet made many preparatory studies, painting the four subjects individually many times: Guillemet as many as fifteen times.  A preparatory study for The Balcony was painted at Boulogne in 1868.  This unfinished portrait of Fanny Claus, the closest friend of Manet’s wife Suzanne Leenhoff; Claus married Manet's friend Pierre Prins in 1869.  The work was bought after Manet's death in a studio sale by John Singer Sargent.  The portrait had only been seen once in public since it was first painted in 1868, but in 2012 the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford succeeded in raising the funds to acquire it and keep it permanently in a public collection in the United Kingdom.[3][4]

The painting was not well received when it was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1869.  The aggressive and bold green of the balcony rails drew much attention, as evidenced by the article devoted to the work by the Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle in 1878 which stated:[5] ""This painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1869 and is one of those who contributed to form this reputation for eccentricity realistic, this reputation of bad taste that was attached to Mr. Manet."" The press considered the painting as ""discordant"". The contrast of colours (the background completely black, the white faces and clothes, the blue tie of the man, and the green railings) contributes to create an atmosphere of ""mystery"".[2]

Manet deliberately eschewed any sense of connection between the figures, treating them more like objects in a still life than living people.  None of them looks at the others.  One commentator, the caricaturist Cham, sarcastically called for the shutters to be closed.  Morisot herself said ""Je suis plus étrange que laide; il paraît que l'épithète de femme fatale a circulé parmi les curieux (""I look more peculiar than ugly; it seems that people asking about it have used the words femme fatale to describe me."").  Albert Wolff described it as ""coarse art"""" at ""the level of house painters"".

Manet kept the painting until his death in 1883, hanging it near his painting of Olympia.  It was bought from the sale of Manet's estate in February 1884 by Gustave Caillebotte, who paid 3,000 francs.  Caillebotte displayed it in a prominent position in his house at Gennevilliers.  On his death in 1894, Caillebotte's will left the painting, with other works, to the French state.  It was displayed at the Musée du Luxembourg from 1896 to 1929, then at the Musée du Louvre until 1986 (from 1947, at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume). It was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986.

Surrealist René Magritte painted Perspective II: Manet's Balcony[6] in 1950, a commentary on the present work. On the balcony are four coffins (one ""seated"") in place of the four people. Michel Foucault said of Magritte's painting, ""C'est bien cette limite de la vie et de la mort, de la lumière et de l'obscurité, qui est là, manifestée par ces trois personnages"" (It is this limit of life and death, of light and darkness, which is there, manifested by these three characters).[7] Magritte told Foucault, ""For me the setting of The Balcony offered a suitable place to put coffins. The 'mechanism' at work here might form the object of a learned explanation, which I am unable to provide. The explanation would be valid, indeed beyond question, but that would not make it any less mysterious.""[8]

Manet's Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus has been considered a sketch for The Balcony. As a preparatory sketch for the finished product, Mademoiselle Claus' portrait captures the artist's overarching intentions. It is her peering eyes over the balcony that suggest her position as a flaneuse, the feminine equivalent to the flâneur who would have been described at the time as a passante. Nesci (2007) introduces the concept of the flaneuse and positions the existence of this feminine figure as early as the 1830s.[9] By scrutinising the masculine figure of the flaneur and uncovering the figure of the flaneuse, ""helps us question the conditions of inclusion and exclusion of public urban life"".[9] Both the balcony context of The Balcony and the Portrait depict this question of inclusion and exclusion of public urban life, placing women on a balcony peering onto (and therefore gazing) the public urban life, whilst retaining a close physical proximity with their domestic environment (the inside of the house alluded to by the dark space between the two green windows. This act of gazing onto public urban life and reflecting on it without being a part of it is ""central to the definition of the flaneur"".[10] Manet's The Balcony and the individual sketches he produced prior to the full composition and therefore examples of what 21st century scholars are unravelling in their scrutiny of the masculine flaneur and uncovering of the existence of a very present flaneuse.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17582581,"Virgil reading the Aeneid before Augustus, Livia and Octavia, known in French as  Tu Marcellus Eris, is an 1812 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It is an oil on canvas measuring 304 x 323 cm (120 x 127 in.) and is in the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse. It depicts the moment when Virgil, reciting his work to the Emperor Augustus, his wife Livia and his sister Octavia, mentions the name of Octavia's dead son, Marcellus, causing Octavia to faint.[1] Augustus' advisors, Marcus Agrippa and Gaius Maecenas, can be seen watching in the background.[2]  The painting is based on an anecdote, recorded in the late fourth-century vita of Virgil by Aelius Donatus, in which the poet read the passage in Book VI in praise of Octavia's late son Marcellus, and Octavia fainted with grief. This anecdote has also been depicted in works by other artists, including Jean-Joseph Taillasson, Antonio Zucchi, Jean-Baptiste Wicar, Jean-Bruno Gassies and Angelica Kaufmann.

Ingres was commissioned in 1811 by the French governor of Rome, General Miollis, a wealthy patron of the arts, to depict this event for his own residence, the villa Aldobrandini.[3] The painting was delivered the next year. Sometime after 1835, Ingres repurchased it and made extensive modifications to the  composition.[4] Ingres's modifications included changes to the architectural setting and the addition of the figures of Agrippa and Gaius Maecenas at the far right.[2] He also added canvas to the top edge to convert the composition to a vertical format, but was dissatisfied with the result and removed the addition.[2] Ingres bequeathed the painting, which remained unfinished at his death in 1867, to the city of Toulouse.[3]

Over the course of 53 years, Ingres revisited this scene from antiquity in over 100 drawings and watercolours and three oil paintings. One of these paintings, a three-figure fragment cut from an abandoned version, is in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels.[4] In 1825 he made a chalk drawing in vertical format as a model for a reproductive engraving made by Pradier in 1832.[5] In the drawing and the print, a sculpture of Marcellus stands behind and above the four central figures.[6] In 1865, Ingres painted a third version in oil (Philadelphia, La Salle University Art Museum) by painting over a copy of the Pradier print.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q98801354,"The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist and an Angel is a religious painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Giovanni Antonio Bazzi aka Il Sodoma, dated to c. 1535–1540. It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 351.[2]

The painting was bought in Florence in 1894 by Wilhelm von Bode, and was identified as a Sodoma from the start, although some Fin de siècle critics expressed their disregard for what they considered ""a badly restored work"" (as it turned out after thorough scientific examination in 1978, the work had in fact not been substantially altered at all). Until the 2010s, Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist and an Angel had been considered as a work from Sodoma's early period, predating his journey to Rome in 1509, but stylistic and iconographic examinations from 2017 have established that it has much more probably been painted in Siena in the second half of the 1530s.[1]

The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist and an Angel is one of Sodoma's multiple variations on the extended theme (Holy Family, Holy Family with John the Baptist, Holy Family with John the Baptist and an angel), and quite characteristic for his style. One original aspect of the Strasbourg version is the unusual posture of the (rather feminine) angel, who appears to hold John the Baptist in a motherly fashion.[1]

The Venus of Martres was discovered in 1826 at Chiragan villa in Martres-Tolosane. It is currently on display on the first floor of Musée Saint-Raymond as exhibit Ra 52 (formerly Inv. 30328).

The Venus of Martres consists of a marble head in good general condition, although the tip of the nose is damaged. The shape of the neck indicates it might have been part of a bust or of a full-size statue. The hair is held in place by a ribbon that circles the head twice and shapes it into a bun. The face is slightly asymmetrical.

In his 1828 catalogue[1] Alexandre Dumège identifies the fragment as representing Venus:

Imitation of the greatest perfection that nature produced, and ideal beauty itself, could not depict in more admirable forms this goddess whom Lucretius named delight of men and gods[2]
In 1865, Ernest Roschach[3] instead identifies it to a depiction of Diana:

It might as well be seen as Diana. It even seems that the proud beauty of the face and the energic development of the neck muscles would rather justify this attribution and hint at the chaste goddess, accustomed to running in the woods and take deep inbreaths of the fotrifying air of the mountains.[4]"

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17494945,"Pèlerins allant à La Mecque (Pilgrims Going to Mecca) is a painting by Léon Belly. It is a very large (160cm x 242cm) oil on canvas work. It won a first class medal at the Salon of 1861, was bought by the state from the artist, and originally displayed at the Musée du Luxembourg. Since 1983 it has been part of the collection at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris. From the time it was first exhibited it has been considered a masterpiece of orientalist painting.[1]

The work depicts a caravan of Muslims going on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. In 1856, the artist had come across such a caravan while he was in Egypt and then worked for nearly three years to create this work.[2] The precision with which Belly depicted both the camels and the human figures gives this painting an almost photographic quality.[3]

Compared with many more romantic portrayals of Middle Eastern people, Belly’s work is both realistic and sympathetic. His pilgrims are elderly, tired, and very ordinary looking, though their composure, as well as the work’s composition, lend them a quality of nobility.[4] Belly was concerned to portray an ethnographically exact image of a pilgrimage.[5] One of the most important elements of the painting is the way it uses the effects of light.[6] Additionally, it was one of the first orientalist works to give prominence to the camel.[4][7]

The painting has been featured in numerous exhibitions, including:[1]

The first paintings for the Studiolo were completed by Andrea Mantegna, and he appears to have started this painting, but it was completed  by Costa between 1506 - 1511, after Mantegna's death, when Costa had been named court painter.[1]

The iconography of this painting is complex. To the left of the foreground tree, a sitting Comus, the ruler of a land of bacchanals, with his head tilted looks at Venus. To his right, Apollo seems to serenade another sitting woman. In the center, Dionysus strokes the hair of a drunken maiden, identified as Nicaea. She had spurned his advances; and he overpowered her with wine in order to rape her.[2] Meanwhile, to the right of an elaborate arch, Janus bifrons and Hermes shoo away poorly clothed figures from the enjoyments of Comus.[3]

The elaborate painting may have a moral justifying some of the virtues of reveling, or perhaps it is a melancholic work which exalts as virtuous, only Nicaea, the one character oblivious to the orgies around her.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2610675,"

The Fortune Teller is a painting by Italian Baroque artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It exists in two versions, both by Caravaggio, the first from c. 1594 (now in the Musei Capitolini in Rome), the second from c. 1595 (which is in the Louvre museum, Paris). The dates in both cases are disputed.

The painting shows a foppishly-dressed boy (in the second version the model is believed to be Caravaggio's companion, the Sicilian painter Mario Minniti), having his palm read by a Romani girl. The boy looks pleased as he gazes into her face, and she returns his gaze. Close inspection of the painting reveals what the young man has failed to notice: the girl is removing his ring as she gently strokes his hand.[citation needed]

Caravaggio's painting, of which two versions exist, shows a well-groomed, vain young man having his palm read by a Romani woman. The wily Romani woman is guilty of deceit, however: her seductive smile is false, and because the young man has been charmed off his feet by her beauty, he does not notice that she has meanwhile slipped the ring from his finger.[1] In 1603 the poet Gaspare Murtola dedicated a madrigal to Caravaggio's Fortune Teller, in which he compares the deceit of the sensuous Romani woman with the illusionistic manner of Caravaggio, therefore implying that the viewer, like the young man, is the victim of duplicity.[2]
The madrigal is addressed to Caravaggio himself:
`Non so qual sia più maga /
O la donna, che fingi, /
O tu che la dipingi. /
Di rapir quella è vaga /
Coi dolci incanti suoi /
Il core e ’l sangue a noi.
Tu dipinta, che appare /
Fai, che viva si veda.
Fai, che viva, e spirante altri /
la creda.'
[3]

(I don't know who is the greater sorcerer /
The woman you portray /
Or you who paint her.
Through sweetest incantation /
She doth desire to steal /
Our very heart and blood.
Thou wouldst in thy portrayal /
Her living, breathing image /
For others reproduce,
That they too may believe it.)

Caravaggio's biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori relates that the artist picked the Romani girl out from passers-by on the street in order to demonstrate that he had no need to copy the works of the masters from antiquity:

This passage is often used to demonstrate that the classically trained Mannerist artists of Caravaggio's day disapproved of Caravaggio's insistence on painting from life instead of from copies and drawings made from older masterpieces. However, Bellori ends by saying, ""and in these two half-figures [Caravaggio] translated reality so purely that it came to confirm what he said."" The story is probably apocryphal – Bellori was writing more than half a century after Caravaggio's death, and it doesn't appear in Mancini's or in Giovanni Baglione, the two contemporary biographers who had known him –  but it does indicate the essence of Caravaggio's revolutionary impact on his contemporaries – beginning with The Fortune Teller – which was to replace the Renaissance theory of art as a didactic fiction with art as the representation of real life.

The 1594 Fortune Teller aroused considerable interest among younger artists and the more avant garde collectors of Rome, but, according to Mancini, Caravaggio's poverty forced him to sell it for the low sum of eight scudi. It entered the collection of a wealthy banker and connoisseur, the Marchese Vincente Giustiniani, who became an important patron of the artist. Giustiniani's friend, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, purchased the companion piece, Cardsharps, in 1595, and at some point in that year Caravaggio entered the Cardinal's household.

For Del Monte, Caravaggio painted a second version of The Fortune Teller, copied from the Giustiniani but with certain changes. The undifferentiated background of the 1594 version becomes a real wall broken by the shadows of a half-drawn curtain and a window sash, and the figures more completely fill the space and defining it in three dimensions. The light is more radiant, and the cloth of the boy's doublet and the girl's sleeves more finely textured. The dupe becomes more childlike and more innocently vulnerable, the girl less wary-looking, leaning in towards him, more in command of the situation.

The Fortune Teller is one of two known genre pieces painted by Caravaggio in the year 1594, the other being Cardsharps. The Fortune Teller is believed to be the earlier of the two, and dates from the period during which the artist had recently left the workshop of the Giuseppe Cesari to make his own way selling paintings through the dealer Costantino.

The subject of the painting was not unprecedented. In his Lives of the Artists, Giorgio Vasari notes that one of Franciabigio's followers, his brother Agnolo, painted a sign for a perfumer's shop ""containing a gipsy woman telling the fortune of a lady in a very graceful manner"".[4][5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1565086,"Les Choristes (""The Chorus""[1] or ""The Chorus Singers""[2]) is an 1877 pastel on monotype by French artist Edgar Degas. Part of a series of similar works depicting daily public entertainment at the time, it shows a group of singers performing a scene from the opera Don Giovanni, the only work by Degas depicting an operatic performance without dancers.[1][3]

Les Choristes, and other contemporary works of the artist such as Café-Concert at Les Ambassadeurs, show the influence of French caricaturists of the era. Honoré Daumier is often invoked, but critics and art historians have identified others. Critics at the time praised it, with one suggesting that the singers' ""hideous"" faces made them seem more real.

After its initial exhibition, Les Choristes was purchased by Gustave Caillebotte, a fellow painter and friend of Degas's who used his own large inheritance to support fellow Impressionists. Caillebotte bequeathed it to the state upon his death in 1894, which added it to the collection of the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris, and then later exhibited it at the Louvre. In 1986 it was moved to the Musée d'Orsay with other works of modern art.

At the end of 2009, while on loan to the Musée Cantini in Marseille, the work was stolen. Investigators were unable to find any leads. It was recovered in 2018 when customs inspectors found it in the luggage compartment of a bus they searched in the department of Seine-et-Marne outside Paris; the thieves have not been identified. After being found to be relatively undamaged, it was displayed again at the Musée d'Orsay.

The work is a pastel drawn over an earlier monotype, a technique Degas used for some other works around this time, also depicting performers. While some of them led to multiple works, Les Choristes is the only one known to have been derived from this particular monotype. It is rectangular, almost square, 27 centimetres (11 in) high by 32 centimetres (13 in) wide.[1]

It depicts a line of singers along a stage, seen from just to their left and slightly in front. They are illuminated by footlights from in front. All have open mouths; most also have a hand extended towards the audience. The exceptions are the third singer, who seems to be reaching back towards his chest, and the fourth singer behind him, who appears to be raising a sword. They are wearing predominantly orange and yellow costumes.[1]

The faces of the singers in the foreground are distinct, although lacking detail, reflecting the Impressionist aesthetic of the work. In the very background two box seats can be seen overlooking the stage, with patrons, one above the other on a red wall. Degas signed the image at lower left.[1]

Degas told Daniel Halévy that the scene depicted is one from a specific opera, Mozart's Don Giovanni. Specifically, it is the end of the first act, with the chorus celebrating the engagement of Massetto and Zerlina. While other works by Degas depict operatic performances, this is the only one that shows only singers, without any dancers.[1]

Don Giovanni had not been performed much in Paris until 1866, when Jean-Baptiste Faure, who had commissioned works from Degas, was able to apply his baritone to the title role, after which there were many productions. At the time of Les Choristes, Degas had also illustrated Halévy's father Ludovic's Monsieur Cardinal, which takes place backstage during a performance of the opera. Several of those illustrations depicted dancers preparing for, or in, other scenes from Don Giovanni.[1]

Gustave Caillebotte, a painter who used his large inheritance to support many of the early Impressionists, bought the work from Degas and lent it to the Third Impressionist Exhibition in 1877, soon after it was finished. The title was shortened to simply Choristes. Critics at the time saw it as furthering Degas's place as the Impressionist most concerned with realism in his choice of subjects and representation. ""And the hideous chorus, bawling in full voice,"" wrote one admirer, ""aren't they real!""[1]

Many critics, looking at all of Degas's work in the show, saw the strong influence of caricature on his work. In particular, they compared his figurative stylings to Honoré Daumier, whom Degas admired to the point of owning several of his works. La Petite Republique Française went further, comparing Les Choristes and other paintings depicting performers offstage and on—Café-Concert and Dancers at the Barre among them—favorably with the work of Paul Gavarni and  Alfred Grévin. ""No one, including [them], has seen the world of the wings and the café-concert in as humorous a fashion"", the journal wrote. ""[The works] are a collection of true and witty satire.""[4]

Appreciation for the work, as part of those Degas showed in 1877, did not diminish with the passage of time. In 1897, when the work was put on exhibit at the Musée du Luxembourg, Léonce Bénédite called Les Choristes part of a group of ""acute, ironic and cruel observations ... the work of a firm, sure hand [and] just, sensible eye."" He called them ""little masterpieces"" that a public not generally aware of Degas's genius had done well to acquire.[5]

After the show ended, Caillebotte took Les Choristes back into his private collection. He lent it out for one other exhibit, another show focusing on the Impressionists, in New York in 1886. In this exhibit it went under the title Chorus d'Opéra.[1]

At his death eight years later, he left all his art to the state, and Les Choristes was exhibited at the Musée du Luxembourg. During World War I, it was again included in American traveling exhibits, this time to San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Buffalo. After being included in a Degas retrospective in 1924, was transferred to the Louvre in 1929.[1]

For the next 80 years Les Choristes did not leave Paris. It was part of several different exhibits devoted to pastels and Impressionism at the Louvre, and then transferred to the newly opened Musée d'Orsay in 1986. It was part of a special exhibit of Degas works two years later.[6]

In 2009 the Orsay loaned Les Choristes to the Musée Cantini in Marseille for ""De la scène au tableau"" (""The Scene in Painting""), a multi-artist exhibit. On the last morning of the year, shortly before the exhibit ended, the security guard who opened the museum for the day found the painting missing.[7]

The thieves had apparently just unscrewed the frame and taken the work, valued at €800,000, off the wall. Investigators believed that, as in many cases of art theft, they had had some help from someone working at the museum. They detained and briefly interviewed a night watchman, but could find no reason to hold him, and released him. After that they had no leads.[2]

It was serendipitously recovered a little over nine years later. On February 16, 2018, French customs officers pulled over and searched an intercity bus off an exit from the A4 autoroute in Ferrières-en-Brie, 30 kilometres (19 mi) east of Paris in the department of Seine-et-Marne. They were primarily looking for illegal drugs, since smugglers prefer bus routes to ship them.[2]

They did not find any drugs on this occasion, but inside a suitcase in one of the luggage compartments was a small artwork; none of the passengers said it was theirs. They soon confirmed that it appeared to be the missing Les Choristes, although they did not know if it was authentic despite the Degas signature. Experts from the Orsay soon confirmed that it was, and it was undamaged.[3]

Several days later, in a joint news release, the customs agency and the Ministry of Culture announced the recovery of Les Choristes. Culture Minister Françoise Nyssen praised the customs service for ""the fortunate recovery of a precious work whose disappearance had been a great loss to our national Impressionist heritage."" Gérald Darmanin, Minister of Public Action and Accounts, said ""the constant vigilance of customs"", which had seized 10,000 possibly stolen works of art during 2017, had again proved its value in protecting French heritage.[8]

The previous year, the Orsay had marked the centenary of Degas's death with an exhibit of his work focusing on his relationship with Paul Valéry. The museum announced that it would include Les Choristes in an exhibit of the artist's work depicting opera, set to open in September 2019. After that, the exhibit will travel to Washington, D.C., where it will open at the National Gallery of Art in March 2020.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3439636,"Roger Freeing Angelica or Ruggiero Freeing Angelica is an 1819 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, inspired by Orlando Furioso by Ariosto. An oil painting on canvas measuring 147 x 199 cm, it is owned by the Louvre.[1] Ingres subsequently painted several variants of the composition.

Orlando Furioso, a 16th-century epic poem by Ariosto, is the source of the tale of Roger, a knight whose steed is a hippogriff (a legendary creature half horse and half eagle). While riding near Brittany's coast Roger espies a beautiful woman, Angelica, chained to a rock on the Isle of Tears. She has been abducted and stripped naked by barbarians who have left her there as a human sacrifice to a sea monster. As Roger rides to her aid, a great thrashing in the water occurs—it is the monster approaching Angelica. Roger drives his lance between the monster's eyes and rescues Angelica.[2]

Ingres received the commission for the work in 1817 and completed it in 1819.[3] When it was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819 alongside his Grande Odalisque, the work was criticised for the treatment of Angelica's figure, described by the art historian Théophile Silvestre as ""Angelica with goitres"" and by the painter Henry de Waroquier as ""triple-breasted Angelica"". Comte de Blacas, the French ambassador to the Vatican, acquired the painting for King Louis XVIII.[3] It was installed above a doorway in the throne room of Versailles from 1820 until 1823 before being relocated to the Musée du Luxembourg.[3] It  was Ingres' first painting to enter a public collection.

Ingres executed the work with his usual care, and many preparatory drawings for the composition and the individual figures exist. 

He painted several later versions of the composition, none of which are known to have been commissioned.[4] A reduced copy of the painting in a vertical format was painted sometime before 1839, and eventually acquired by Edgar Degas, who purchased it in 1894.[5] It was later acquired by the National Gallery, London. An 1841 replica, in an oval format, is in the Musée Ingres. A painting of 1859, also in an oval format, repeats the figure of Angelica but nearly eliminates Roger, whose presence is indicated only by his shield visible at the right edge.[6] In 1825–30 Ingres painted Perseus and Andromeda (Detroit Institute of Arts), which like Roger Freeing Angelica features a nude woman chained to a rock and a hero slaying a sea monster.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2529703,"Portrait of Émile Zola is a painting of Émile Zola by Édouard Manet. Manet submitted the portrait to the 1868 Salon.

At this time Zola was known for his art criticism, and perhaps particularly as the writer of the novel Thérèse Raquin.  This told the story of an adulterous affair between Thérèse, the wife of a clerk in a railway company, and a would-be painter named Laurent, whose work, rather like that of Zola's friend Paul Cézanne, is denigrated by the critics.[1] In the eleventh chapter the milieu of Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe is evoked, in the murder scene, where Camille, the husband, goes out for the day with his wife and her lover to Saint-Ouen.

On the wall is a reproduction of Manet's Olympia, a controversial painting at the 1865 Salon but which Zola considered Manet's best work. ""Behind it is an engraving from Velazquez's Bacchus indicating the taste for Spanish art shared by the painter and the writer.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q531329,"The Embarkation for Cythera (""L'embarquement pour Cythère"") is a painting by the French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau.

It is also known as Voyage to Cythera and Pilgrimage to the Isle of Cythera.[1]  Watteau submitted this work to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture as his reception piece in 1717.[2] The painting is now in the Louvre, Paris. A second version of the work, sometimes called Pilgrimage to Cythera to distinguish it, was painted by Watteau about 1718 or 1719[3] and is in the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin.  These elaborated a much simpler depiction painted by Watteau in 1709 or 1710, which is now in Frankfurt.

The painting portrays a ""fête galante""; an amorous celebration or party enjoyed by the aristocracy of France after the death of Louis XIV, which is generally seen as a period of dissipation and pleasure, and peace, after the sombre last years of the previous reign.

The work celebrates love, with many cupids flying around the couples and pushing them closer together, as well as the statue of Venus (the goddess of love).  There are three pairs of lovers in the foreground.  While the couple on the right by the statue are still engaged in their passionate tryst, another couple rises to follow a third pair down the hill, although the woman of the third pair glances back fondly at the goddess’s sacred grove. At the foot of the hill, several more happy couples are preparing to board the golden boat at the left. With its light and wispy brushstrokes, the hazy landscape in the background does not give to any clues about the season, or whether it is dawn or dusk.

It has often been noted that, despite the title, the people on the island seem to be leaving rather than arriving, especially since they have already paired up.  Many art historians have come up with a variety of interpretations of the allegory of the voyage to the island of love. Watteau himself purposely did not give an answer.

In the ancient world, Cythera, one of the Greek islands, was thought to be the birthplace of Venus, goddess of love. Thus, the island became sacred to the goddess and love. However, the subject of Cythera may have been inspired by certain 17th century operas or an illustration of a minor play. In Florent Carton (Dancourt)'s Les Trois Cousines (The Three Cousins), a girl dressed as a pilgrim steps out from the chorus line and invites the audience to join her on a voyage to the island, where everyone will meet their ideal partner.  Watteau's Actors of the Comédie-Française (c. 1711 or later) is now thought to contain portraits of a cast for this play.

It was around 1710 that Watteau painted his first, more literal version of the subject, which nonetheless bears a compositional similarity to the Louvre painting. This work is now in the Städtische Galerie im Städelschen Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt-am-Main.

When Watteau was accepted as a member of the Academy in 1714, he was expected to present the customary reception piece. Although he was given unusual freedom in choosing a subject for his painting, his failure to submit a work brought several reprimands.[4] Meanwhile, Watteau worked on numerous private commissions that his rising reputation brought him. Finally, in January 1717, the Academy called Watteau to task, and in August of that year he presented his painting, which had been painted quickly in the preceding eight months.[5]

The painting caused the Academy to invent a new classification for it, since the subject was so striking and new. This resulted in the fête galantes (elegant fêtes or outdoor entertainments), a genre subsequently practiced by imitators of Watteau, such as Jean-Baptiste Pater and Nicolas Lancret. While the creation of the new category acknowledged Watteau as the originator of the genre, it also prevented him being recognised as history painter, the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, later said: ""The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles.""[6][7]

In years after Watteau’s death, his art fell out of fashion. During the French Revolution, some eighty years after the work was painted, his depictions of lavishly set pastoral escapades were associated with the old days of the monarchy and a frivolous aristocracy. This particular piece, which had entered the collection of the Louvre in 1795, was used by art students for target practice; an account by Pierre-Nolasque Bergeret (1782–1863) describes the drawing students throwing bread pellets at it.[8][9] In the early 19th century the curator at the Louvre was forced to place it in storage until 1816 in order to protect the painting from angry protesters. It was not until the 1830s that Watteau and the Rococo returned into fashion.

In 1904 Claude Debussy wrote a piece for solo piano titled ""L'isle joyeuse"", which may have been inspired by the painting; the colorful and brilliant piano writing depicts the ecstasy of the lovers.[10] Four decades later, Debussy's compatriot Francis Poulenc wrote a lively piece for two pianos which took the name of the painting for its title, ""L'Embarquement pour Cythere"".

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20005936,"Going for a Walk in the Amsterdam Town Hall (c. 1663–1665) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch. It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg. Its inventory number is 213.[2]


This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote:
199. GOING FOR A WALK. deG. 86.[3] In a vestibule decorated after the pseudo-antique style of the late Renaissance a couple are walking to the right. The gentleman wears a tall, broad-brimmed hat with red and white feathers, and has a red cloak embroidered with gold over his white silk jacket. The lady, seen in profile, has round her head a black veil partly concealing her gold-embroidered bodice, and with her right hand lifts up her yellow skirt. In front of them, to the right, is a dog. Behind them, between the columns to the left, comes a nurse with a little girl. The floor is paved with tiles, which are laid in circles in the foreground and in a square pattern farther back. The hall is surrounded by columns on the left and by pilasters on the right. By the wall at the back is a nude statue, between two arched doorways; the left-hand door is open and looks into another room, the lighting of which is apparently wrong. In this room is a high window, with a table under it and a chair to the right; the floor is paved with square tiles. At the back, by the entrance to the room beyond, there was originally the figure of another man, which has been painted out; the dog also has been repainted in a different way. The colouring of the principal figures is harmonious, but in the figure of the nurse the purple tones characteristic of the late period are obvious. The curtain, the table-cloth, and the chair-cushion in the back room are vermilion. The cloth over the chest is a dull green. The brushwork even in the background is quite in the manner of P. de Hooch. The picture might well be taken as a typical Janssens, but it is unquestionably a genuine de Hooch, dating from the commencement of the Amsterdam period. The signature is false; canvas, 28 1/2 inches by 34 inches. 

Mentioned by Waagen (iii. p. 222), and by Burger, Tresors d' Art en Angleterre, 1852 (p. 317). Exhibited at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, 1857, No. 950 (by Galton). 


Sale. H. Reydon, Amsterdam, April 5, 1827, No. 54; a man with a black cloak is mentioned in the background probably the figure described above as having been painted out. In the collection of Howard Galton, Hadzor House, Droitwich, 1850-1857. Afterwards in the possession of the dealer E. Warneck, Paris. Purchased by Dr. W. Bode for the Strassburg Gallery. Now in the Municipal Picture Gallery at Strassburg, No. 128 in the 1899 catalogue.[4]
The vestibule decorated after the pseudo-antique style of the late Renaissance described here is a gallery of the main hall of the (then) Amsterdam City Hall (today the Royal Palace of Amsterdam). The relief at the back is by the hand of Artus Quellinus and depicts Mercury, and the circular tiles in front are a map of the world in the marble floor:

Mercury

View of a gallery of the Royal Palace on the Dam (the people are standing around one of the world maps in marble, protected today with a low gate to preserve the inscriptions)

De Hooch made at least two more paintings with scenes of the interior of the City Hall:

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15918393,"Portrait of Madame Aymon, La Belle Zélie is an 1806 oil on canvas painting by the French artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. The painting is one of Ingres' early painted portraits, completed just before his first stay in Rome. It first came to public notice during an 1867 Ingres exhibition in Paris, and was acquired by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen in 1870.[1]

Although the work is signed and dated on the lower left of the canvas,[1] the identity of the sitter is uncertain. The painting was untitled when it entered the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, shortly beforehand she was tentatively identified as a Madame Aymon (disputed by the Beaux-Arts de Rouen) with the portrait given the nickname of La belle Zélie, a reference to a popular song in the 1870s,[1] mentioned because of the ""subtle hint of vulgarity"" apparent in the painting.[2] If the sitter is a Madame Aymon, Ingres may also have portrayed her husband, though no such work is known.[3]

The sitter is shown in three-quarters view, placed against a backdrop of open sky with some clouds. The central canvas is dominated by red, black and brown colours. As with many of Ingres' female portraits, the sitter is given Greek or Raphaelesque features. ""Sensuous and sleepy"",[4] she bears facial resemblance to figures in Ingres' later ""Odalisque"" paintings of harem women.[4] She has an expressive, oval face and almond eyes. Her eyes are slightly parted, her cheeks flushed. The woman's black hair falls over her forehead in three thick curls.[5] She wears long diamond earrings on her unusually elongated ear, and a pearl necklace on her unnaturally long, ""swan like"" neck.[6][7] Her silk bodice is brown and low-cut with a wide neckline, worn over a crimson shawl. The painting is full of accentuating curves; from the oval cut of the canvas, to the round hair curls, the shape of her face and the shape of her necklace.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q185255,"The Wedding Feast at Cana (Nozze di Cana, 1562–1563), by Paolo Veronese, is a representational painting that depicts the biblical story of the Wedding at Cana, at which Jesus miraculously converts water into red wine (John 2:1–11). Executed in the Mannerist style (1520–1600) of the late Renaissance, the large-format (6.77 m × 9.94 m) oil painting comprehends the stylistic ideal of compositional harmony, as practised by the artists Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo.[1]: 318 

The art of the High Renaissance (1490–1527) emphasised human figures of ideal proportions, balanced composition, and beauty, whereas Mannerism exaggerated the Renaissance ideals – of figure, light, and colour – with asymmetric and unnaturally elegant arrangements achieved by flattening the pictorial space and distorting the human figure as an ideal preconception of the subject, rather than as a realistic representation.[1]: 469  The visual tension among the elements of the picture and the thematic instability among the human figures in The Wedding Feast at Cana derive from Veronese's application of technical artifice, the inclusion of sophisticated cultural codes and symbolism (social, religious, theologic), which present a biblical story relevant to the Renaissance viewer and to the contemporary viewer.[2]

From the 16th to the 18th centuries, the painting hung in the refectory of the San Giorgio Monastery. In 1797, soldiers of Napoleon's French Revolutionary Army plundered the picture as war booty during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802). The pictorial area (67.29 m2) of the canvas makes The Wedding Feast at Cana the most expansive picture in the paintings collection of the Musée du Louvre.

At Venice, on 6 June 1562, the Black Monks of the Order of Saint Benedict (OSB) commissioned Paolo Veronese to realise a monumental painting (6.77 m × 9.94 m) to decorate the far wall of the monastery's new refectory, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio, at the San Giorgio Monastery, on the eponymous island. In their business contract for the commission of The Wedding Feast at Cana, the Benedictine monks stipulated that Veronese be paid 324 ducats; be paid the costs of his personal and domestic maintenance; be provided a barrel of wine; and be fed in the refectory.[3][better source needed]
f
Aesthetically, the Benedictine contract stipulated that the painter represent “the history of the banquet of Christ’s miracle at Cana, in Galilee, creating the number of [human] figures that can be fully accommodated”,[4] and that he use optimi colori (optimal colours) — specifically, the colour ultramarine, a deep-blue pigment made from lapis lazuli, a semi-precious, metamorphic rock.[5] Assisted by his brother, Benedetto Caliari, Veronese delivered the completed painting in September 1563, in time for the Festa della Madonna della Salute, in November.[3]

In the 17th century, during the mid–1630s, supporters of Andrea Sacchi (1599–1661) and supporters of Pietro da Cortona (1596–1669) argued much about the ideal number of human figures for a representational composition.[6] Sacchi said that only a few figures (fewer than 12) permit the artist to honestly depict the unique body poses and facial expressions that communicate character; while da Cortona said that many human figures consolidate the general image of a painting into an epic subject from which sub-themes would develop.[6] In the 18th century, in Seven Discourses on Art, the portraitist Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792) said that:

The subjects of the Venetian painters are mostly such as gave them an opportunity of introducing a great number of figures, such as feasts, marriages, and processions, public martyrdoms, or miracles. I can easily conceive that [Paolo] Veronese, if he were asked, would say that no subject was proper for an historical picture, but such as admitted at least forty figures; for in a less number, he would assert, there could be no opportunity of the painter's showing his art in composition, his dexterity of managing and disposing the masses of light, and groups of figures, and of introducing a variety of Eastern dresses and characters in their rich stuffs.[7] 
As a narrative painting in the Mannerist style, The Wedding Feast at Cana combines stylistic and pictorial elements from the Venetian school's philosophy of colorito (priority of colour) of Titian (1488–1576) to the compositional disegno (drawing) of the High Renaissance (1490–1527) used in the works of Leonardo (1452–1519), Raphael (1483–1520), and Michelangelo (1475–1564).[8] As such, Veronese's depiction of the crowded banquet-scene that is The Wedding Feast at Cana is meant to be viewed upwards, from below – because the painting's bottom-edge was 2.50 metres from the refectory floor, behind and above the head-table seat of the abbot of the monastery.[4]

As stipulated in the Benedictine contract for the painting, the canvas of monumental dimensions (6.77m x 9.94m) and area (67.29m2) was to occupy the entire display-wall in the refectory. In the 16th century, Palladio's great-scale design was Classically austere; the monastery dining-room featured a vestibule with a large door, and then stairs that led to a narrow ante-chamber, where the entry door to the refectory was flanked by two marble lavabos, for diners to cleanse themselves;[9] the interior of the refectory featured barrel vaults and groin vaults, rectangular windows, and a cornice.[9] In practise, Veronese's artistic prowess with perspective and architecture (actual and virtual) persuaded the viewer to see The Wedding Feast at Cana as a spatial extension of the refectory.[9][10]

In The Wedding Feast at Cana, Veronese represents the water-into-wine miracle of Jesus in the grand style of the sumptuous feasts of food and music that were characteristic of 16th-century Venetian society;[3] the sacred in and among the profane world where “banquet dishes not only signify wealth, power, and sophistication, but transfer those properties directly into the individual diner. An exquisite dish makes the eater exquisite.”[11]

The wedding banquet is framed with Greek and Roman architecture from Classical Antiquity and with architecture of the Renaissance, Veronese's contemporary era. The Graeco-Roman architecture features Doric order and Corinthian order columns surrounding a courtyard that is enclosed with a low balustrade; in the distance, beyond the courtyard, there is an arcaded tower, by the architect Andrea Palladio. In the foreground, musicians play stringed instruments of the Late–Renaissance, such as the lute, the violone, and the viola da gamba.[8]

Among the wedding guests are historical personages, such as the monarchs Eleanor of Austria, Francis I of France, and Mary I of England, Suleiman the Magnificent, tenth sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; the poetess Vittoria Colonna, the diplomat Marcantonio Barbaro, and the architect Daniele Barbaro; the noblewoman Giulia Gonzaga and Cardinal Pole, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, the master jester Triboulet and the Ottoman statesman Sokollu Mehmet Paşa – all dressed in the sumptuous Occidental and Oriental fashions alla Turca popular in the Renaissance.[8]

According to 17th-century legend and artistic tradition, the painter of the picture (Paolo Veronese) included himself in the banquet scene, as the musician in a white tunic, who is playing a viola da braccio. Accompanying Veronese are the principal painters of the Venetian school: Jacopo Bassano, playing the cornetto, Tintoretto, also playing a viola da braccio, and Titian, dressed in red, playing the violone;[13] besides them stands the poet Pietro Aretino considering a glass of the new red wine.[3][12] A more recent study links the identity of the performer seated behind Veronese playing viola da gamba with Diego Ortiz, musical theorist and then chapell master at the court of Naples.[14]

The Wedding Feast at Cana is a painting of the Early Modern period (1453–1789); the religious and theological narrative of Veronese's interpretation of the water-into-wine miracle is in two parts.[10]

I. On the horizontal axis –  the lower-half of the painting contains 130 human figures; the upper-half of the painting is dominated by a cloudy sky and Graeco-Roman architecture, which frames and contains the historical figures and Late-Renaissance personages invited to celebrate the bride and bridegroom at their wedding feast.[3] Some human figures are rendered in foreshortened perspective, the stylisation of Mannerism; the old architecture mirrors the contemporary architecture of Andrea Palladio; the narrative treatment places the religious subject in a cosmopolitan tableau of historical and contemporary personages, most of whom are fashionably dressed in costumes from the Orient — Asia as known to Renaissance society in the 16th century.[8]

Seated behind and above the musicians are the Virgin Mary, Jesus of Nazareth, and some of his Apostles. Above the figure of Jesus, on an elevated walkway, a man watches the banquet, and a serving maid waits for the carver to carve an animal to portions. To the right, a porter arrives with more meat for the feasting diners to eat. The alignment of the Jesus figure under the carver's blade and block, and the butchered animals, prefigure his sacrifice as the Lamb of God.[3]

bottom-right-quarter –  a barefoot wine-servant pours the new, red wine into a serving ewer, from a large, ornate oenochoe, which earlier had been filled with water. Behind the wine servant stands the poet Pietro Aretino, intently considering the red wine in his glass.[3]

bottom-left-quarter –  the steward of the house (dressed in green) supervises the black servant-boy proffering a glass of the new, red wine to the bridegroom, the host of the wedding feast; at the edge of the nuptial table, a dwarf holds a bright-green parrot, and awaits instructions from the house steward.

II. On the vertical axis –  the contrasts of light and shadow symbolise the co-existence of mortality and vanitas, the transitory pleasures of earthly life; the protocol of religious symbolism supersedes the social protocol.

In the wedding banquet proper, the holy guests and the mortal hosts have exchanged their social status, and so Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and some of his Apostles, are seated in the place of honour of the centre-span of the banquet table, whilst the bride and bridegroom sit, as guests, at the far end of the table's right wing. Above the Jesus figure, a carver is carving a lamb, beneath the Jesus figure, musicians play lively music, yet, before them is an hourglass – a reference to the futility of human vanity.[8] Moreover, despite the kitchen's continuing preparation of roasted meat, the main course of a celebratory meal, the wedding guests are eating the dessert course, which includes fruit and nuts, wine and sweet quince cheese (symbolically edible marriage); that contradiction, between kitchen and diners, indicates that the animals are symbolic and not for eating.[10]

From the 16th to the 18th centuries, for 235 years, the painting decorated the refectory of the San Giorgio Monastery, until 11 September 1797, when soldiers of Napoleon's French Revolutionary Army plundered the painting as war booty during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802). To readily transport the oversized painting – from a Venetian church to a Parisian museum – the French soldiers horizontally cut and rolled up the canvas of The Wedding Feast at Cana, to later be re-assembled and re-stitched in France.[15] In 1798, Veronese's 235-year-old painting was stored in the first floor of the Louvre Museum; five years later, in 1803, that store of looted art had become the Musée Napoléon, the personal art collection of the future Emperor of the French.[16]

In the early 19th century, after the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), the repatriation of looted works of art was integral to the post–Napoleonic conciliation treaties of France with Europe. Appointed by Pope Pius VII, the Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova negotiated the Treaty of Tolentino (1797) for the French repatriation of Italian works of art that Napoleon had plundered from the Papal States. Yet the chauvinist curator of the Musée Napoléon, Vivant Denon, falsely claimed that Veronese's canvas was too fragile to travel from Paris to Venice, and Canova excluded The Wedding Feast at Cana from repatriation to Italy, and, in its stead, sent to Venice the Feast at the House of Simon (1653), by Charles Le Brun.[15] In the late 19th century, during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), The Wedding Feast at Cana was stored in a box at Brest, in Brittany.

In the mid 20th century, during the Nazi Occupation of France (1940–1945), the 382-year-old painting was rolled up for storage, and continually transported to hiding places throughout the south of France, lest Veronese's painting about the Marriage at Cana become part of the Nazi plunder collected during the Second World War.[16]

In the early 21st century, on 11 September 2007, the 210th anniversary of the Napoleonic looting of the painting from Italy in 1797, a full-sized (6.77 m x 9.94 m) computer-generated (1,591 files), digital facsimile of The Wedding Feast at Cana was hung in the Palladian refectory of the Monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, which the Giorgio Cini Foundation, Venice, and the Musée du Louvre, Paris, commissioned from Factum Arte, in Madrid.[17]

In 1989, the Louvre Museum began a painting restoration of The Wedding Feast at Cana, which provoked an art-world controversy like that caused by the 11-year Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes (1989–1999). Organised as the Association to Protect the Integrity of Artistic Heritage (APIAH), artists protested against the restoration of the 426-year-old painting, and publicly demanded to be included in the matter, which demand the Louvre Museum denied.[16]

To the APIAH, especially controversial was the Museum's removal of a rouge marron red hue over-painting of the tabard coat of the house steward, who is standing (left-of-centre) in the foreground supervising the black, servant-boy handing a glass of the new, red wine to the bridegroom. The removal of the red hue revealed the original, green colour of the tabard. In opposing that aspect of the painting's restoration, the APIAH said that Veronese, himself, had changed the tabard's colour to rouge marron instead of the green colour of the initial version of the painting.[17]

In June 1992, three years into the restoration of the painting, The Wedding Feast at Cana twice suffered accidental damage. In the first accident, the canvas was spattered with rainwater that leaked into the museum through an air vent. In the second accident, which occurred two days later, the Louvre curators were raising the 1.5-ton-painting to a higher position upon the display-wall when a support-frame failed and collapsed. In falling to the museum floor, the metal framework that held and transported the painting punctured and tore the canvas; fortuitously, the five punctures and tears affected only the architectural and background areas of the painting, and not the faces of the wedding guests.[16]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2275610,"The Circus (French: Le Cirque) is an oil on canvas painting by Georges Seurat.  It was his last painting, made in a Neo-Impressionist style in 1890–91, and remained unfinished at his death in March 1891.  The painting is located at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.

The painting was Seurat's third major work treating the theme of the circus, after his Parade (Circus sideshow) of 1887-88 and Le Chahut of 1889–90. It depicts a female performer standing on a horse at the Circus Fernando (renamed the Circus Médrano in 1890, after its most famous clown).  The Circus Médrano was located at the corner of the Rue des Martyrs and the Boulevard de Rochechouart, close to Seurat's studio.  It was a popular entertainment in Paris, depicted in the 1880s by other artists such as Renoir (for example,  Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)), Degas (for example, Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando) and Toulouse-Lautrec (for example, Equestrienne (At the Circus Fernando)).

Seurat makes use of Charles Henry's theories on the emotional and symbolic meaning of lines and colours, and the works of Chevreul and Ogden Rood on complementary colours.  He was also influenced by Japanese prints, and the graphic works of Jules Chéret.  The work is similar to chromolithograph Au cirque by Karl Gampenrieder, but it is not clear if Seurat had seen it.

The work measures 185 × 152 centimetres (73 × 60 in) (dimensions with frame painted by the artist: 232 x 198.5 cm). Seurat used a Neo-Impressionist Divisionist style, with pointillist dots creating the sense of other colours.  The work is dominated by white and the three primary colours, mainly red and yellow with blue shading.  A deeper blue border painted around the edge of the canvas, merging into a flat frame in the same shade of blue.

The painting is divided into two spaces, with the circus artists occupying the lower right, characterised by curves and spirals creating a sense of movement, and the audience occupying the upper left, confined to rows of benches. The audience shows the distinctions between social classes sitting in rows, from the well-dressed higher classes near the front (sitting in the front row, in a top hat, is Seurat's friend and fellow painter Charles Angrand) to the lower classes in the gallery at the back.

A sense of space is created by the whiteface clown in the foreground, facing away from the viewer, and the tiers of bleachers.   Another pair of clowns are tumbling to the right behind the ringmaster.

Seurat made few preparatory studies, concentrating on creating dynamic lines and using few colours.

Le Cirque was first exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in March 1891, in an unfinished state.  The work remained unfinished at Seurat's death a few days later: in places, the white ground and a grid of blue lines used by Seurat to create his composition are still visible.  Early critics complained that the subjects were stiff, like automatons.  Others later saw it as a forerunner of Cubism.

The painting was returned to Seurat's mother after the exhibition in 1891, and she hung it in the room in the Boulevard de Magenta where he had died.  The painting was acquired by Paul Signac around 1900, and then by American collector John Quinn, who donated the painting to the Louvre in 1927.  It was exhibited at the Musée du Luxembourg, the Musée National d'Art Moderne and the Galerie du Jeu de Paume.  It has been located at the Musée d'Orsay since 1977.

Jean Baptiste Joseph Gentil (1726-1799) was a French army colonel, Knight of the Royal and Military Order of Saint-Louis, who worked in India. He is known for the collections he made of historic manuscripts and artifacts from India and for his cartography and documentation of Mughal history.[1]

Gentil was born in Bagnols-sur-Cèze in a noble family on 25 June 1726. He joined the army in 1752 in India and served under Dupleix, Bussy, Law de Lauriston, Comte de Conflans and Lally. After the English took over Pondicherry in 1761, he served with General Lauriston to block the English advance in Chandernagore in Bengal. The French joined hands with Nawab Mir Qasim and declared war on the English East India Company forces. He became a friend of Khwaja Gregory (Gorgin Khan, Armenian minister and commander-in-chief of the Nawab of Bengal from 1760-1763) and was a witness to his assassination following internal conspiracies.[2] Gentil later joined the court of Shuja-ud-Doulah at Oudh, becoming the French Resident there.[1] He also helped set up a battalion of French mercenaries who served Shuja-ud-Doulah. The battalion was disbanded after his death.[3]

While serving at Oudh, he purchased a large collection of objects of natural history, weapons, medals and manuscripts in many languages. When he returned to France he donated these collections to the royal library and museum. He also produced maps of the region and wrote on the history of the Moghul Empire. He was present at the battle of Buxar.[1]

Gentil married Theresa Velho at Faizabad in 1772. Theresa was a grand-niece of Juliana Dias da Costa.[3] He retired to France in 1778 and died in Bagnols-sur-Cèze in 1799.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3387944,"Pierrot, also retrospectively known as  Gilles, is an oil on canvas painting of c. 1718-1719 by the French Rococo artist Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684–1721). Completed in the later phase of Watteau's career, Pierrot measures 184.5 by 149.5 cm, which makes up somewhat unusual case in the artist's body of work. The painting depicts a number of actors portraying commedia dell'arte character types, with one as the titular character set in the foreground.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24283841,"Bathing or Children Bathing is an oil-on-canvas painting in the collection of the Louvre Museum, which depicts landscape with children played naked on and around a boat on a body of water with a windmill in the distance. It is presumed to have been painted between 1655 and 1660.  While the work was traditionally attributed to the Dutch painter Nicolaes Maes, this attribution has been regularly disputed.[1]

The painting was acquired by the Louvre in 1914 from the collection of the estate of Baron Schlichting.[1]  At the time of its acquisition by the Louvre it was thought to be an early work by Nicolaes Maes. During the 1920s and 1930s many art historians raised doubts as to the attribution and suggested its style was closer to that of other artists, such as Jacob van Loo.[2]  Various alternative attributions have been proposed over the years including to François Verwilt, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, Godfried Schalcken, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten, Jan Vermeer, Cornelis Bisschop and Justus de Gelder.  Justus de Gelder was a stepson of Maes and an amateur painter known for some genre paintings in the style of Maes executed in a less accomplished manner.[1]

While the painting appears to solely depict an idyllic genre scene of children having fun in and around a boat on the water, various elements point to an underlying moral lesson.

Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil on canvas painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It depicts Louis-François Bertin (1766–1841), the French writer, art collector and director of the pro-royalist Journal des débats. Ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French upper-middle class. Ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. He is physically imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through – warm, wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust.

The painting had a prolonged genesis. Ingres agonised over the pose and made several preparatory sketches. The final work faithfully captures the sitter's character,[1] conveying both a restless energy and imposing bulk. It is an unflinchingly realistic depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning hair of an overweight man who yet maintains his resolve and determination. He sits in three-quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right, his fingers are pronounced and highly detailed, while the polish of his chair reflects light from an unseen window.

Ingres' portrait of Bertin was a critical and popular success, but the sitter was a private person. Although his family worried about caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as Léon Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and Félix Vallotton. Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.

Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, the year of the portrait.[1] He befriended Ingres either through his son Édouard Bertin, a student of the painter,[2] or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journal's art critic.[3] In either case the genesis of the commission is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists.[4] Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.[2]

It was completed within a month, during Ingres' frequent visits to Bertin's estate of retreat, Le Château des Roches, in Bièvres, Essonne. Ingres made daily visits, as Bertin entertained guests such as Victor Hugo, his mistress Juliette Drouet, Hector Berlioz, and later Franz Liszt and Charles Gounod.[5] Ingres later made drawings of the Bertin family, including a depiction of his host's wife and sketches of their son Armand and daughter-in-law, Cécile. The portrait of Armand evidences his physical resemblance to his father.[6]

Ingres' early career coincided with the Romantic movement, which reacted against the prevailing neoclassical style. Neoclassicism in French art had developed as artists saw themselves as part of the cultural center of Europe, and France as the successor to Rome.[7] Romantic painting was freer and more expressive, preoccupied more with colour than with line or form, and more focused on style than on subject matter. Paintings based on classical themes fell out of fashion, replaced by contemporary rather than historical subject matter, especially in portraiture. Ingres resisted this trend,[8] and wrote, ""The history painter shows the species in general; while the portrait painter represents only the specific individual—a model often ordinary and full of shortcomings.""[9] From his early career, Ingres' main source of income was commissioned portraits, a genre he dismissed as lacking in grandeur. The success of his The Vow of Louis XIII at the 1824 Salon marked an abrupt change in his fortunes: he received a series of commissions for large history paintings, and for the next decade he painted few portraits.[10]  His financial difficulties behind him, Ingres could afford to concentrate on historical subjects, although he was highly sought-after as a portraitist. He wrote in 1847, ""Damned portraits, they are so difficult to do that they prevent me getting on with greater things that I could do more quickly.""[11]

Ingres was more successful with female than male portraits. His 1814 Portrait of Madame de Senonnes was described as ""to the feminine what the Louvre's Bertin is to the masculine"". The sitter for his 1848 Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild looks out at the viewer with the same directness as Bertin, but is softened by her attractive dress and relaxed pose; she is engaging and sympathetic rather than tough and imposing.[11]

Ingres was self-critical and consumed by self-doubt. He often took months to complete a portrait,[12] leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive,[13] three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.[14]

The earliest study has Bertin standing and leaning on a table in an almost Napoleonic pose.[15] His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face.[16] Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.[4]

Frustrated by his inability to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled ""consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and just as long as you want me to come, I am at your orders.'""[17] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design.

Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons.[18] According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (who said he had heard the story from Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.[19] Bertin said that Ingres, confident that he had finally established the pose for the portrait, ""came close and speaking almost in my ear said: 'Come sit tomorrow, your portrait is [as good as] done.'""[20][21] Bertin's final pose reverses the usual relationship between the two men. The artist becomes the cool, detached observer; Bertin, usually calm and reasoned, is now restless and impatient, mirroring Ingres' irritation at spending time on portraiture.[22]

Bertin is presented as strong, energetic and warm-hearted.[4] His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as ""crab-like claws ... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are the sleeves of his coat.""[23] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his ""nearly ferocious presence"" is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar.[24]

The painting is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are the whites of his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion[24] and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair.[25] In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome.[26] Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer in a manner that is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak,[27] his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty.[28] Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face.[29] Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.[13]

Ingres seems to have adapted elements of the approach and technique of Hans Holbein's 1527 Portrait of William Warham, now in the Louvre. Neither artist placed much emphasis on colour, preferring dark or cool tones. The Warham portrait seems to have informed the indicators of Bertin's aging and the emphasis on his fingers.[30] Jacques-Louis David also explored hyper-realism in his depictions of Cooper Penrose (1802) and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (1817). In the later painting, David shows tiny glints of light reflecting on the sitter's chair and painstakingly details ""every wayward curl of [Sieyès'] closely cropped auburn hair.""[31]

The Greek meander pattern at the foot of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, confining the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon.[32] The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right.[24] This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.[33]

The painting is signed J.Ingres Pinxit 1832 in capitals at the top left, and L.F. Bertin, also in capitals, at the upper right.[34] The frame is the original, and thought to have been designed by Ingres himself. It shows animals around a sinuous and richly carved grapevine. Art historians Paul Mitchell and Lynn Roberts note that the design follows an old French tradition of placing austere male portraits within ""exuberantly carved"" frames. The frame closely resembles that of Raphael's c. 1514–15 Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione, a painting that influenced Ingres, especially in colour and tone.[35]  A similar frame was used for Ingres's 1854 painting of Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII.[36]

Monsieur Bertin was exhibited at the 1833 Salon alongside his 1807 Portrait of Madame Duvaucey. It met with near universal  praise to become his most successful artwork to that point. It sealed his reputation as a portraitist, reaching far enough into public consciousness to become a standard for newspaper political satires. Today it is considered his greatest portrait. Ingres viewed all this as a mixed blessing, remarking that ""since my portraits of Bertin and Molé, everybody wants portraits. There are six that I've turned down, or am avoiding, because I can't stand them.""[37] Before the official exhibition, Ingres displayed the painting in his studio for friends and pupils. Most were lavish in their praise, although Louis Lacuria confided to a friend that he feared people might ""find the colouring a bit dreary"".[38] He proved correct; at the Salon, critics praised the draftsmanship, but some felt the portrait exemplified Ingres' weakness as a colourist.[39] It was routinely faulted for its ""purplish tone""—which the ageing of the oil medium has transformed over time to warm greys and browns.[40] Bertin's wife Louis-Marie reportedly did not like the painting; his daughter, Louise, thought it transformed her father from a ""great lord"" to a ""fat farmer"".[41]

Given the standings of the two men, the painting was received in both social and political terms. A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either ""bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential"".[38] There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the ""opportunism and cynicism"" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered ""what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism"".[42]

Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as ""powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled"". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a ""fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!""[43] Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: ""A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature"".[18]

The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as ""at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive"".[44] She notes that there is a certain amount of projection of the artist's personality and recalls Théophile Silvestre's description of Ingres; ""There he was squarely seated in an armchair, motionless as an Egyptian god carved of granite, his hands stretched wide over parallel knees, his torso stiff, his head haughty"".[44] Some compared it to Balthasar Denner, a German realist painter influenced by Jan van Eyck. Denner, in the words of Ingres scholar Robert Rosenblum, ""specialised in recording every last line on the faces of aged men and women, and even reflections of windows in their eyes.""[24] The comparison was made by Ingres' admirers and detractors alike. In 1833, Louis de Maynard of the Collège-lycée Ampère, writing in the influential L'Europe littéraire, dismissed Denner as a weak painter concerned with hyperrealistic ""curiosities"", and said that both he and Ingres fell short of the ""sublime productions of Ingres' self-proclaimed hero, Raphael.""[38]

The following year Ingres sought to capitalise on the success of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise.[45] Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.[46]

Bertin bequeathed the portrait to his daughter Louise (1805–1877) on his death. She passed it to her niece Marie-Louise-Sophie Bertin (1836–1893) wife of Jules Bapst, a later director of the Journal des débats. They bequeathed it to their niece Cécile Bapst, its last private owner. In 1897 Cécile sold it to the Musée du Louvre for 80,000 francs.[40]

The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted,[47] while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a ""direct citation"" of Ingres' portrait.[48]

Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein.[24] Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, ""Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference"".[47] Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her ""massive, monumental presence"".[49] In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait,[47] prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, ""That's Madame Bertin!""[50]

The influence continued through the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams between 1952 and 1961.[51] In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.[52]

Philosopher in Meditation, recently renamed Philosopher in Contemplation by the museum, is the traditional title of an oil painting in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, that is attributed to the 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt.

It is signed ""RHL-van Rijn"" and dated 1632, at the time of Rembrandt's move from Leiden to Amsterdam.[1] Recent scholarship suggests that the painting depicts ""Tobit and Anna waiting for their son Tobias"" instead. This interpretation is given in an auction catalogue from 1738 (see ""Subject matter""), the earliest known source that clearly refers to this painting.

The painting was brought to Paris from The Hague in the middle of the 18th century and made the rounds of aristocratic collections before being acquired for the royal collections housed in the Louvre Palace.[2] The presumed subject matter of philosophical meditation, the finely graded chiaroscuro treatment and the intricate composition were widely appreciated in France. The painting is mentioned in the writings of many 19th- and 20th-century literary figures, including George Sand, Théophile Gautier, Jules Michelet, Marcel Proust, Paul Valéry, Gaston Bachelard, Paul Claudel, and Aldous Huxley.

The ongoing popularity of the painting may be measured by its presence on the internet, where it is often used as an emblem of philosophy, or interpreted along esoteric or occult lines.

Painted in oils on an oak panel measuring about 11 x 13 in. (28 x 34 cm), the painting depicts in slightly accelerated perspective two figures in a partially vaulted interior that is dominated by a wooden spiral staircase. The architecture includes stone, brick and wood, with arched elements (window, vault, doors) that create an impression of monumentality. On the pre-iconographic level, this is one of the most ""graphic"" works painted by Rembrandt, in the sense that it contains many straight, curved, circular, and radiating lines: from the lines of the flagstones to those of the window, the bricks, the wainscotting, and of course the staircase. As in the staircase and the basketwork tray at the center of the composition, the curved lines can be said to organize the straight lines.[3] The most conspicuous figure is that of an old man seated at a table in front of a window, his head bowed and his hands folded in his lap. The second figure is that of an old woman tending a fire in an open hearth. A third figure—a woman standing in the stairs carrying a basket and turned to the spectator—is visible in 18th- and 19th-century engraved reproductions of the painting, but virtually invisible in the painting's present state.[4] As it is, the overall lighting is warm and quite subdued owing to the yellowing of the varnish.[5]

The panel is signed ""RHL-van Rijn 163_"" at the bottom and left of the center, at a vertical from the figure of the old man. The signature was traced with a fine brush in light pigment on a dark background and is quite difficult to make out. The last digit is a tiny blob of paint, the form and placing of which would tally with a ""0,"" ""1"" or ""2.""[6] The type of signature—monogram plus patronymic—would argue for 1632, since the artist is known to have used this type of signature only in that year.[7] This does not mean that the picture was painted in that year or even in Amsterdam, to which Rembrandt had moved in late 1631. In any case, this type of signature is so rare in Rembrandt's oeuvre and date-specific that it argues for authenticity.[8]

Close consideration of the known provenance explains how a Dutch scene of biblical domesticity could be turned into a French image of philosophical meditation. In this process, the role of the supposed companion piece (see below), with which it was paired for two centuries and which was also attributed to Rembrandt, proved determinant. Summary mentions of a ""Winding stair with a seated old man"" in 17th-century inventories could apply to either painting.[9] The earliest unambiguous reference to the painting is in the catalogue for the sale of the collection of the comte de Fraula in Brussels in 1738. The catalogue gives the measurements of the panel and the description: Een Ordonnantie met Tobias, ende eenen drayenden Trap, door Rimbrant (A Composition with Tobit, and a Winding Stair, by Rembrandt).[10]

The painting was bought by Jacques de Roore, an agent bidding on behalf of Willem Lormier, art collector and dealer in The Hague, whose wax seal is still on the back of the panel.[11] On 27 June 1748, Lormier sold the painting for Dfl. 525 to the French collector Marc-René Voyer, marquis d'Argenson.[12] In his manuscript list of the 17 paintings that he sold to Voyer on that occasion, Lormier referred to it as Oud Mannetje en wenteltrap (Old Man with a winding stair). His disregard of the Tobit subject cited in the Fraula catalogue may be due to the fact that he did not attend the auction personally and that he did not own the catalogue.[13]
Voyer appears to be the originator of the old man's philosophical vocation, most likely inspired by the companion piece, which he also owned and which clearly shows a scholar in his study. Today, this former ""pendant"", titled Philosopher with an open book, is attributed to Salomon Koninck.[14]

As late as 1982, the two paintings were believed to have shared the same provenance as far back as 1734, but this was disproved by the Rembrandt Research Project.[15] Korthals Altes claims that Voyer already owned the Koninck when he acquired the Rembrandt, but cites no evidence.[16] In fact, nothing is known of the earlier provenance of the Koninck, or which of the two paintings he acquired first. Assuming that it was the Rembrandt, Anne Leclair notes that: ""At an unknown date, Voyer acquired a second 'Philosopher"" that he deemed close enough in style and format to make it a pendant"".[17] In notes on his ""pendants"" set down around 1750, Voyer pointed out that ""chance brought them together"".[18]

Although he waxed enthusiastic about these prized possessions, calling them ""unique"", by 1752, he had already sold them to his friend, Claude-Alexandre de Villeneuve, comte de Vence. The latter had the two reproduced for the catalogue of his collection by Louis Surugue with the titles Philosophe en méditation (Koninck) and Philosophe en contemplation (Rembrandt). Significantly, the engraver reproduced the Koninck picture first and showed it at the Salon of 1753,[19] while he reproduced the Rembrandt in the following year and showed it at the Salon of 1755.[20] This was the beginning of a long series of graphic reproductions, both in France and Great Britain, that spread the fame of the two ""Philosophers"", while catering to the vogue for pendants.[21]

The comte de Vence died in 1760, stipulating in his testament that Voyer could choose two paintings from his collection. Interestingly enough, Voyer did not select the two ""pendants"", but only the Philosophe en contemplation (Rembrandt), thus separating the very pair that he had created and further attesting to the arbirariness of their association.[22] At the sale of the comte de Vence's collection in 1761, the Philosophe en méditation (Koninck) was purchased for 2,999 livres by a relative of the deceased, the marquis de Vence, who turned around and sold it to the duc de Choiseul, then Secretary of State for the Navy and War.[23] Wanting to curry favor with the influential duc de Choiseul, Voyer offered to part with his treasured Rembrandt so that the latter could enjoy possession of both ""Philosophers"". And so, for another 3,000 livres the two paintings were reunited in 1762, not to be separated again until 1955.

The ""Philosophers"" continued their brilliant career in Paris, changing hands every few years: Randon de Boisset in 1772 (14,000 livres), Millon d'Ailly in 1777 (10,900 livres), who then sold it to the comte de Vaudreuil.[24] The culmination came when the two pictures were acquired by Alexandre-Joseph Paillet for the royal collection of Louis XVI in 1784 (13,000 livres) and given the honors of the Louvre Palace.

While the traditional title Philosopher in Meditation has to a large extent been responsible for the painting's popularity, it is iconographically untenable. The painting shows none of the conspicuous attributes of scholarship or philosophy—books, globe, scientific instruments, etc.—and the presence of at least one other figure involved in domestic tasks does not fit in with the solitude associated with study and meditation.[25] Though a large book and a quill seem to be among the few objects on the table in front of the main figure, they are summarily depicted and impossible to identify more precisely: a Bible alone would not suffice to make the figure depicted a scholar or ""philosopher."" Staircases—whether spiral or not—were not an attribute of philosophy in the early 17th century. Similar observations argue against identifying the main figure as an ""alchemist,"" a subject that would allow for other figures, such as an assistant tending a fire. 

The objects depicted suggest a domestic setting, yet the improbable architecture speaks more for a history than a genre subject. The French art historian Jean-Marie Clarke[26] argues that the scene is ultimately derived from the Book of Tobit, one of Rembrandt's favorite Old Testament sources.[27] The sole objection to this interpretation is that, apart from the two main figures—the blind Tobit and his wife Anna— there is no typical iconographic attribute, specifically Anna's spinning wheel. Nevertheless, a plausible interpretation of the scene is Tobit and Anna waiting for the return of their only son, also called Tobias, a scene that Rembrandt had already represented in another version in 1630, in which Anna's spinning gear is minimally indicated.[28] This is supported by an 18th-century source identifying a Rembrandt painting of exactly the same format representing a ""Composition with Tobit and a winding stair.""[29] The Rembrandt Research Project dismisses this evidence as ""certainly incorrect since there are two women in the picture and there is no specific motif from the story of Tobias-"" [30]

Earlier inventory mentions of a ""winding stair with an old man sitting on a chair"" or ""winding stair"" attributed to Rembrandt are vague and might even refer to the companion painting long attributed to Rembrandt, but now given to Salomon Koninck.[31]
Although the title in the Louvre's publications remains Philosophe en méditation[32]  catalogues of Rembrandt's painted oeuvre, starting with Bredius (1935) identify the subject more soberly as a ""Scholar in an Interior with a Winding Stair.""[33] With the rejection of the attribution to Rembrandt by the Rembrandt Research Project in 1986, the title became ""Old Man in an interior with a winding staircase.""[34]

The explanation for the long-standing misinterpretation of the Philosopher in Meditation lies in the fact that, in the second half of the 18th century, it was sold and collected together with a panel of identical size (28 x 33.5 cm) that presented similar motifs—in particular a spiral staircase—and was also attributed to Rembrandt. The paintings were exhibited together and titled interchangeably Philosophe en méditation and Philosophe en contemplation, or referred to simply as the Philosophes.[35] The companion painting shows an old man in a vaulted interior seated in front of a table at a window on which we can see books, a globe, and a crucifix. These accessories and his solitary condition make him a more plausible candidate for philosophical pursuits than the old man in the so-called Philosopher in Meditation, who occupies a space shared by at least one other person, and maybe even two. In spite of the obvious differences in the composition and execution, its attribution to Rembrandt was never called into question. The exception is the American art historian John C. Van Dyke, who whittled Rembrandt's oeuvre down to less than fifty paintings and made short shrift of the Louvre's Philosophers: ""Small pictures over which, in the past, there has been much spilling of good printer's ink with no marked results. The pictures are not wonderful..."". With that, he attributed the paintings to Salomon Koninck, though one, today's Rembrandt, only tentatively.[36] In 1955, examinations with X-rays and infrared photography at the laboratory of the Louvre revealed notable differences in treatment and caused the attribution to Rembrandt finally to be dropped.[37]

Jacques Foucart (1982), Curator for Dutch and Fleming Painting at the Louvre, like Horst Gerson (1968)[38] and Werner Sumowski (1983),[39] attributes this work to Salomon Koninck (1609–1656), a Rembrandt imitator, dating it to around 1645 and titling it Philosopher with an Open Book.[40] The subject matter and details of the Koninck picture seem to have been directly inspired by a Rembrandt etching dated 1642 that represents St. Jerome in a dark chamber (Bartsch 105), which is the only other known work by Rembrandt that features a complete helical staircase.[41] The traditional iconography of the Doctors of the Church and St. Jerome provided the attributes for 17th-century representations of scholars in their study, which included books, a globe, and often a human skull.[42] The identical format might well be a product of chance (standard supply) and it was long believed that the ""pendant"" had been enlarged by 2 cm at the top, but an examination of the panel by Clarke and Foucart in 1988 revealed that it was of one piece. Any further speculation on the relationship between the two paintings must take into account manuscript notes from around 1750 written by their first French owner, the marquis de Voyer d'Argenson, who states that the two pictures were brought together ""by chance.""[43] The provenance of the former companion piece previous to the late 1740s remains unknown: a wax seal on the back has not yet been identified.[44]

In the second volume of its Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings, which covers the years 1631–1634, the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) rejected the attribution to Rembrandt of the Philosopher in Meditation. Until then, and except for the ""heretical"" John C. Van Dyke, this attribution had been unanimously accepted by experts and art historians. The RRP did not introduce any new objective or documentary evidence, but based its judgment on an assessment of Rembrandt's ""habits,"" an appraisal of the painting's style, and the difficulty of fitting it within Rembrandt's production in 1632 or the later 1630s.[45] The RRP did not make any guesses as to who the author of this painting might have been, but relegated it to ""Rembrandt's immediate circle, or even to his own workshop.""[45] This judgment was criticized by Jean-Marie Clarke[46] who maintained the traditional attribution to Rembrandt and pointed out that the RRP might have had a special stake in rejecting this painting, as the following quote suggests:
""In the later part of the 18th century the painting enjoyed a great reputation in France as Le Philosophe en contemplation, and it helped to determine the image of Rembrandt's art to an unwarranted extent.""[47]

This disattribution was not accepted by the Louvre and other Rembrandt scholars,[48] and the newly configured RRP has changed its stance since then. In the fifth volume of the Corpus (2011), which covers ""small history paintings,"" the painting is classified without further ado as a ""re-attribution"" by the director of the RRP, Ernst van de Wetering.[49] The painting was officially re-instated in vol. 6 of the Corpus under no. A86 with the title Interior with a window and a winding staircase and the parenthetical information: ""a study in Kamerlicht."" [50]  There is no further mention of the issue of perspective that was highlighted by the Rembrandt Research Project in volume II when it disattributed the painting and called it just that: a study in perspective.[51] Considering the fact that it is supposed to be a study, this painting is executed in great detail (down to individual nails in the woodwork) and bears a signature and date. There is no evidence that ""studies"" or ""interiors"" with figures but without a narrative were in demand on the art market. The inconsistencies in the Rembrandt Research Project's position do not lend credence to its argument that, here, Rembrandt was working without reference to  iconography.[52]

In a lecture given at the Goetheanum in Dornach (1916), the ex-theosophist and founder of the Anthroposophical Society, Rudolf Steiner, described the Louvre Philosopher as the ""purest expression of light and dark... All that you see here—the architecture and all the other features—merely provided the occasion for the real work of Art, which lies in the distribution of light and dark."" This, he held, was precisely the essence of Rembrandt's art. As it was, he showed only a ""lantern slide"" of the companion painting by Salomon Koninck discussed above.[53]

With his inversion of the title, Aldous Huxley (1954) sums up most of the ""deeper"" interpretations of the painting: ""There hangs in the Louvre a Méditation du Philosophe, whose symbolical subject-matter is nothing more or less than the human mind, with its teeming darknesses, its moments of intellectual and visionary illuminations, its mysterious staircases winding downwards and upwards into the unknown.[54]
The caption to an illustration of the painting (reversed) in the psychoanalyst C. G. Jung's Man and His Symbols (1964) reads: ""The inward-looking old man provides an image of Jung's belief that each of us must explore his own unconscious.""[55]

Jean-Marie Clarke (1980) advanced a psychological interpretation based on the circular form of the composition and the Yin-Yang-like distribution of light, reading the painting as a Mandala in the Jungian sense: an archetypal symbol of the integrated Self. The chiaroscuro treatment and the presence of many straight lines that are structured by curved lines speaks for an effort at reconciling oppositions. Further, Clarke interpreted the concentricity of the composition and wealth of circular motifs as metaphors for the underlying theme of the painting: the eye and vision. Like Julius Held,[56] Clarke believes that the drawing dated ca. 1630 at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (Benesch 64) with the caption ""HARMAN GERRITS van der Rhijn"" written in Rembrandt's hand that shows his father in a pose similar to that of Tobit here, suggests that he may have been blind at the end of his life.[57] Accordingly, the figure of the blind old man (Tobit) would stand for Rembrandt's father (d. 1630), who opposed his son's wish to become an artist and whose vision the young Rembrandt (Tobias) ""healed"" with the help of the archangel Raphael (""God heals"", a name that also symbolizes Art).[58] More recently, Clarke published an interpretation on the internet that relates Rembrandt's composition to the design of his signature in 1632.[59]

Jean-Pierre Dautun (1983), a student of the French philosopher Raymond Abellio, offered a detailed phenomenological reading along Gnostic lines, interpreting the central motif of the painting (the basketwork tray) as ""the navel, the omphalos of the luminous hermetic secret that Rembrandt wishes to transmit: the phenomenological secret that the eye of the genius will be given to those who will conquer the genius of the eye. It is the ineffable secret of this transmission itself, the 'thou art that' of this mutus liber that is his painting, as if to permit an Occidental satori to a koan of his own devise.""[60] The German art historian Karl Clausberg also pointed out the ""ocular nature"" of the scene and gave it a conceptual framework in his 1999 book ""Neuronale Kunstgeschichte.""[61] The French philosophy professor Régine Pietra (1992) published an essay in which she used the painting to illustrate the rhetorical figure of hypotyposis;[62] Rembrandt's painting, with its interplay of light and dark, renders the experience of philosophical meditation visually perceptible.[63]
The Dutch philosopher Otto B. Wiersma (1999) published an article on the internet that he summarizes in these terms:
""The painting of Rembrandt Philosophe en méditation (1632, Louvre Paris) can be characterized as a pictorial meditation on the miracle of vision. A better title would be Méditation visionnaire, because the painting catches the eye in more than one sense.""[64]
A discussion of the Philosopher in Meditation along essentially Gurdjeffian lines can be found on the Objective Art website (2011).[65]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q38489201,"Nordic Landscape with a Castle on a Hill is a circa 1660 oil painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Allaert van Everdingen. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 560.[2]

This imposing Dutch landscape painting – the largest of its kind in the Strasbourg collection, although among 17th-century landscape paintings there, the Italian Rosa's Landscape with Tobias and the Angel is even larger – was bought in Paris in 1905 by Karl Trübner [fr], on behalf on the museum, and entered the collection in 1908. Its previous history is not known.[1]

Van Everdingen had travelled to Norway and Sweden in 1644, and several of his subsequent landscape paintings, such as the Strasbourg one, are inspired by motives such as hills and mountains, torrents and lakes, forests and skies, as he had seen them there. Only the castle on the hill is not Scandinavian. The Strasbourg painting does not depict a specific place but aggregates different naturalistic elements into a coherent and intimidating whole. This kind of landscape painting was much admired and emulated by the German Nordic school of the early 19th century, most notably by Caspar David Friedrich and Johan Christian Dahl. Nordic Landscape with a Castle on a Hill incidentally includes the depiction of two busy draughtsmen at the lower right, as a probable reminiscence of Van Everdingen's own Northern journey.[1][2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2428778,"Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle (or Eryngium) is an oil painting on parchment pasted on canvas by German artist Albrecht Dürer. Painted in 1493, it is the earliest of Dürer's painted self-portraits and has been identified as one of the first self-portraits painted by a Northern artist.[1] It was acquired in 1922 by the Louvre in Paris.[2]

Dürer looks out at the viewer with a psychologically complex but rather melancholy and reserved, serious minded, facial expression. During the 15th century, thistles  were symbols of male conjugal fidelity.[3]

In 1493, Dürer was 22 years old and working in Strasbourg. He had completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut and his tour as a journeyman, and would marry Agnes Frey on 7 July 1494.[4]

The date and the plant in the artist's hand seem to suggest that this is a betrothal portrait (Brautporträt). Dürer has in fact depicted himself in the act of offering a flowering spray identified by botanists as Eryngium amethystinum: its German name is ""Mannestreue"", meaning conjugal fidelity. Resembling the thistle (from which the portrait's title), this umbelliferous plant is used in medicine, and is regarded as an aphrodisiac.[5] It may also have religious significance; the same plant in outline form is inscribed in the gold ground of  Dürer's painting Christ as the Man of Sorrows (1493–94).[4]

Dürer was temperamentally inclined to philosophical doubts. He often analysed his own face in drawn or painted effigies – sometimes idealizing it, sometimes not. The lines written beside the date in this painting reveal the philosophical and Christian intention of the work:

Myj sach die gatAls es oben schtat.
In other words (and liberally): My affairs follow the course allotted to them on high. Marriage has in part determined his destiny – the Bridegroom puts his future life in the hands of God.[6]

In 1805, Goethe saw a copy of this portrait in the museum at Leipzig and described it as of ""inestimable value.""[7] According to Lawrence Gowing, who calls this ""the most French of all his pictures"", the Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle is singular among Dürer's paintings as ""the touch is freer and color more iridescent than in any other picture one remembers"".[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19359137,"The Fountain of Diana (French: Fontaine de Diane),[1] also known as the Diana of Anet (French: Diane d'Anet)[2] and Diana with a Stag (French: Diane au cerf), is a marble Mannerist sculpture of the goddess Diana, representing Diane de Poitiers. It was created c. 1550 to be the central ornament of a grand fountain in a courtyard of Diane de Poitier's Château d'Anet, but today is in the Louvre, Room 214 (formerly 15b) on the ground floor of the Richelieu Wing (Louvre inventory no. MR 1581 MR sup 123); the Louvre has retitled it Diane appuyée sur un cerf (""Diana leaning on a deer"").[3] It was long believed to be the work of Jean Goujon, but the identity of the sculptor is now considered uncertain, although Benvenuto Cellini, Germain Pilon, Pierre Bontemps, and Ponce Jacquiot [fr] have in turn been suggested.

Diana, the goddess of hunting, is represented with two dogs (a greyhound named Phrocyon and a barbet dog named Cyrius) and a large stag. This striking ensemble has become one of the most famous works of the French Renaissance. Not a true portrait of Diane de Poitiers,[1] it is but one of the many closely related images of moon goddesses, including the paintings Diana the Huntress by a member of the School of Fontainebleau[1] and Le Bain de Diane by François Clouet.[citation needed]

The sculpture was a part of the fountain in Diane de Poitiers's Château d'Anet built by Philibert de L'Orme from 1547.[3] The ensemble, as engraved in its original location by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau and as shown in a 16th-century drawing at the Louvre, differs from its current form. The stag's head and the dog on the left are positioned quite differently.[4] The sculpture was heavily restored in the 18th century and a second time in 1799–1800 by Pierre-Nicolas Beauvallet.[1] Nevertheless, an early 17th-century drawing by Jacques Gentilhâtre in the Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects shows it much as it appears today. In 1953, the British art historian Anthony Blunt argued that the engraving and the earlier drawing are not independent, and the differences are the result of ""the sort of alteration that du Cerceau often made"".[4]

The traditional attribution to Jean Goujon, suggested by Alexandre Lenoir in 18th century, is not accepted today. Other sculptors have been suggested, including Benvenuto Cellini, Pierre Bontemps, Ponce Jacquiot and especially Germain Pilon.[1][5]

The sitter, Bernardo de Iriarte, was a patron and friend of the painter; the dedicatory inscription at the lower edge is testament to both men's ""mutual esteem and affection"". At its unveiling, the painting was hailed for its likeness and its virtuosity, and it has been considered a masterpiece ever since.[1][2][3]

The painting was acquired in November 1941 from the heirs of Camille Groult [fr] by Adolf Wuster and Hans Wendland for the Generalverwaltung der oberrheinischen Museen (General administration of the Upper Rhine museums) at a sale at Hôtel Drouot, and given to the Strasbourg museum.[1] [The accession date was given as 1942 in previous publications.][2]

The composition of the painting is thought to be inspired by an engraving after Titian's A Man with a Quilted Sleeve (National Gallery, London), then thought to be a portrait of Ariosto. Goya's own 1792 Retrato de Sebastián Martínez y Pérez [es] also anticipates on some aspects of Bernardo de Iriarte as far as the attitude and the gaze of the sitter are concerned.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2510869,"Concert in the Egg is a painting formerly considered to be a copy of a lost work by Hieronymus Bosch, and which is currently considered to be based on one of his drawings. Max Jakob Friedländer called it 'an old copy', without specifying another work it was copied from.[1]

The group of singers form the ""yolk"" of the egg, which symbolizes ""fool"" as in ""yokel"". The eel resembles a form of beer (ale). The scene is reminiscent of the similar Ship of Fools. One of the singers is so intent on his song (pointing towards the book) that he fails to notice that he is being robbed by the lute player.

Modern attribution of the painting (to an as yet anonymous follower of Bosch) was based on an analysis of the music in the open book, which shows notes of the chanson Toutes les nuictz by Thomas Crecquillon from 1549.[2]
The work was bought in 1890 for 400 francs by the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille from Morhange, a parisian art dealer.[1] It was featured with the Dutch title Zangers en musici in een ei in an exhibition in 2008 at the Noordbrabants Museum, 's-Hertogenbosch.

Helena Fourment with Children is a c.1636 painting by Peter Paul Rubens, showing his second wife Helena Fourment with their son Frans (born 12 July 1633) in her arms and their daughter Clara Johanna (born 18 January 1632) standing to their left. It was acquired by Louis XVI of France in 1784 and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris.

The painting is an oil on canvas measuring 1.15 m. on 0.85 m.[1]

This represents Hélène Fourment (1614–1673), the second wife of the painter Pierre Paul Rubens. Daughter of a wealthy merchant in tapestries, she married the painter in 1630[2] at the age of 16 while the latter, widower of his first wife, was 53 at the time of the wedding.[3] She is surrounded by two of their children: Clara-Johanna (born in 1632) and Frans (born in 1633).

In the center of the composition, Hélène Fourment wears a simple white dress and hugs her son Frans. The latter looks in the direction of the viewer. Clara-Johanna is standing on the left and turns her gaze towards her mother and her brother.[4]

A pentimento reveals, between the heads of Frans and Clara-Johanna, the arms of a third child, Isabelle, born in 1635. Certain colors have also never been completely affixed, such as the blue in the upper right corner which presents white streaks. Rubens thus leaves a partially unfinished work.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23639890,"Rhinocéros is a 1878 sculpture by Henri Alfred Jacquemart; a life-sized depiction of a rhinoceros in cast iron.  Commissioned to stand outside the Trocadéro Palace for the 1878 Exposition Universelle, it was completed quickly to be ready in time for the opening of the fair.  Well received at the time, it was moved in 1935 to allow for the remodelling of the palace and grounds for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne.  The sculpture was sited near to the Porte de Saint-Cloud [fr] before being acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1985.  It now stands in the esplanade in front of the museum, with two other animal statues from the 1878 exposition.

Rhinocéros is a cast iron sculpture of a male rhinoceros stood on a rock by Henri Alfred Jacquemart.[1]  It is sculpted in life-size proportions and measures  286 centimetres (9.38 ft) in height, 229 centimetres (7.51 ft) in width and 378 centimetres (12.40 ft) in length.[1][2]  It is currently located on the esplanade in front of the Musée d'Orsay, on the Rive Gauche in Paris, France.[2]  It is exhibited alongside two other contemporary large cast iron sculptures: Emmanuel Frémiet's Jeune Éléphant pris au Piège (""Young elephant trapped"") and Pierre Louis Rouillard's Cheval à la herse (""horse with harrow"").[3]

The sculpture was one of four commissioned for the 1878 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair held in Paris.[4]  Ordered in 1877, the sculptures had to be completed in less time than would usually be allowed due to the opening of the exposition.[5][1]  The sculptor, Jacquemart selected the Nantes foundry of J. Voruz the Elder for the work, which was cast in 1878.[1]  The statue was gilded afterwards.[6]

The statue was originally sited near to the Trocadéro Palace, which had been built especially for the exposition.[7]  The Rhinocéros originally stood at one of four corners of a basin near the Trocadéro, which was filled by a waterfall spilling from the rotunda of the palace's concert hall.  The other three corners were also occupied by statues: Frémiet's elephant, Rouillard's horse and an ox by Auguste Cain.[4]  Contemporary criticism was positive with JH Lamprey, writing in July 1878, praising the technical knowledge demonstrated by Jacquemart and rating the sculpture as one of the best of the works at the exhibition.[8] Scribners Monthly of June 1879 complimented Jacquemart's attention to detail and modelling skill and wondered how he had made such a large animal decorative.[4]

The Rhinocéros remained at the Trocadéro until 1935 when the palace was remodelled into the Palais de Chaillot for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne.  The statue was relocated to a site near the Porte de Saint-Cloud [fr].[1]  It was acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1985 and, after restoration at the Coubertin foundry in Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse, was put on display in its current location.[1][9]  The Austrian sculptor Arnulf Rainer, writing in 1988, noted that the Rhinocéros looked as if it was pondering ""some collective prehistoric memory"".[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1314013,"The Intervention of the Sabine Women is a 1799 painting by the French painter Jacques-Louis David, showing a legendary episode following the abduction of the Sabine women by the founding generation of Rome.

Work on the painting commenced in 1796, after his estranged wife visited him in jail. He conceived the idea of telling the story, to honour his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict and the protection of children. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution. Its realization took him nearly four years.

The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia – the daughter of Titus Tatius, leader of the Sabines – rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates.

The rocky outcrop in the background is the Tarpeian Rock, a reference to civil conflict, since the Roman punishment for treason was to be thrown from the rock. According to legend, when Tatius attacked Rome, he almost succeeded in capturing the city because of the treason of the Vestal Virgin Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, governor of the citadel on the Capitoline Hill. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for ""what they bore on their arms"". She believed that she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death and threw her from the rock, later named for her.

The towering walls in the background of the painting have been interpreted as an allusion to the Bastille, whose storming on 14 July 1789 marked the beginning of the French Revolution.[1]

David began planning the work while he was imprisoned in the Luxembourg Palace from 29 May to 3 August 1795. France was at war with other European nations after a period of civil conflict culminating in the Reign of Terror and the Thermidorian Reaction, during which David had been imprisoned as a supporter of Robespierre. David hesitated between representing either this subject or that of Homer reciting his verses to his fellow Greeks. He finally chose to make a canvas representing the Sabine women interposing themselves to separate the Romans and Sabines, as a ""sequel"" to Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women. According to a popular account, he was inspired to paint it in honour of his estranged wife, Charlotte, after she visited him there.[2]

He began preparations shortly after his release, in the autumn of 1795, assisted in his research by his student Pierre-Maximilien Delafontaine.[3] From February 1796, he worked in a temporary studio in the Louvre,[3] and later moved to premises on the Champs-Élysées.[4]

The female models for The Intervention of the Sabine Women were aristocratic women, whose appearances David blended with those of Classical sculptures.[5] Numerous apocryphal anecdotes arose in Paris about the involvement of Adèle de Bellegarde and her sister Aurore, who modelled for the two central Sabine women.[6] Aurore de Bellegarde became David's model for Hersilia, while Adèle modelled for the crouching figure seen to her right.[6] Sources disagree as to how the arrangement began: in the version reported by Miette de Villars in 1850, the sisters and Thérésa Tallien, by then a leading figure in Parisian high society,[7] heard that David had been struggling to find female models and visited his studio in the nude, offering to model for Hersilia.[8] David is said to have exclaimed ""Mesdames, me voilà comme Pâris devant les trois grâces!"" (""Mesdames, here I am like Paris in front of the three Graces!"").[4] In a second version reported by David's student Étienne-Jean Delécluze in 1855, the de Bellegardes were brought to the studio by Madame de Noailles,[a] a friend of David's, and caught the painter's attention with their long and beautiful hairstyles.[10] Certainly, both de Bellegarde sisters were well known among the Parisian art world, and for their acquaintance with artists of various genres.[11]

In de Villars' version, David was most taken by Aurore, who sat for Hersitia, only asking Adèle and Tallien to pose ""out of politeness"".[12] According to Delécluze, however, it was Adèle's long, dark hair that most interested him: at the time, he had already painted the crouching figure next to Hersitia (which had been completed by October 1796),[3] and expressed regret that he had not had de Bellegarde's face as a model from which to do so. De Bellegarde accordingly allowed him to repaint the figure's face and hair after her own,[13] while he used part of Aurore's leg in his figure of Hersitia.[6] David's use of the de Bellegarde sisters as models has been interpreted as creating a link between the mythological Sabine Women and Parisian women of his own time,[14] which has itself been interpreted as ""affording a familial basis for the reconciliation of a divided and warring post-Revolutionary France"".[15]

According to Delécluze, the attention David paid to the painting of Adèle de Bellegarde's face led to rumours of an affair between her and the painter, which Delécluze considered baseless.[13] Other rumours circulated as to whether she had posed fully nude.[11]

The Intervention of the Sabine Women was first exhibited at the Louvre on December 21 1799,[16] a few weeks after the Coup of 18 Brumaire,[17] in what has been described as ""the major artistic event of the late 1790s in Paris.""[18] The diaphanous gowns worn by its female characters were credited for starting a fashion for similar outfits, known as dresses à la antique (""Ancient-style""),[19] among Parisian high society.[20]

The genesis of Les Sabines and the work itself represented a significant departure for the day.[21] Historical depictions had been typically commissioned.  David however, conceived, produced and promoted his work for profit.[22]  He produced marketing material to accompany the first exhibition.  Le Tableau des Sabines, Exposé Publiquement au Palais National des Sciences et des Arts (""the Tableau of the Sabines, Public Exhibition at the National Palace of Arts and Science"") contained his own account of the historic episode and had an endnote explaining his rationale for using nudity in the painting.[23] Its 1799 exhibition attracted a large number of paying visitors for several years. In 1819 David sold Les Sabines and his Léonidas at Thermopylae to the Royal Museums for 10,000 francs.[citation needed]

Starting in 1977, France issued a series of stamps featuring the head of Hersilia based on David's painting.[24]

After the expulsion of artists including David from the Louvre, the painting was held in the ancient church of Cluny, which he used as a workshop. That building is now operated as the Musée de Cluny.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q98635247,"Saint Sebastian and the Angel is a late 1620s painting by the Italian artist from Ferrara, Carlo Bononi. The work is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France.[2]

The unusual painting depicts a martyred Saint Sebastian in almost casual conversation (hand gestures included) with an angel resting on a cloud next to him. It had originally been painted for Ferrara's Oratorio di San Sebastiano, which was dissolved in 1772, and was cut down on all four sides before being sold to private collectors. The painting presents pictorial similarities with The Guardian Angel (Angelo custode), Bononi's acknowledged masterpiece in the Galleria Estense,[3] and was probably painted at roughly the same time, i.e. towards the end of the 1620s.[1][4] A slightly earlier painting of the martyred Saint Sebastian (c. 1622–1623, Reggio Emilia Cathedral) displays more conventional attitudes, and the influence of Guido Reni, less conspicuous in the Strasbourg version.[5]

The painting was bought in Venice in November 1985 by the collectors Othon Kaufmann and François Schlageter, and presented to the museum in 1987. Its inventory number is 44.987.3.1.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3705716,"The Entombment of Christ is a c. 1520[1] painting by Titian, now in the Musée du Louvre, in Paris.

The work was once in the collection of the Gonzaga family, before it was bought in 1627 by Charles I of England. When Charles died, his art was put up for auction by Oliver Cromwell. The Entombment, in particular, was bought by the Parisian banker Jabach and subsequently by Louis XIV in 1662.

Critics have traditionally dated the work to around 1525, since it isn't mentioned in any documents before that time. Assuming it was commissioned by the Gonzagas, the canvas is not mentioned in their letters so it's not traceable to either Isabella d'Este or Federico II Gonzaga. It is believed to be one of the first works commissioned by the Gonzagas from Titian. On February 2, 1523, Federico II wrote to his uncle Alfonso I d'Este to free Titian from any artistic assignments in Ferrara.

There is a copy of The Entombment produced afterwards, perhaps signed by Titian, in the Torrigiani [it] family collection.

The dead Christ is carried to his tomb by three men. Nicodemus holds his shoulders, Joseph of Arimathea his legs, and John the Apostle his arms. Behind them at left, the Virgin Mary is also present, grieving and supported by Mary Magdalene.

The work has a triangular composition that emphasizes the weight of the dead body. Titian also used the direction of light to show the dynamic movement of the body being carried to the right. The contrast of lights and darks concentrates on the body of Christ, the fulcrum of the composition. The viewer's eyes are drawn by the stained light of his legs and shroud and then  towards his upper body, which lies in shadow. The shadows anticipate the darkness of the tomb and serve as a symbol for the painting's theme of death.

Despite the tragedy it depicts, The Entombment demonstrates the spontaneity and fluidity of classic bas-reliefs. For this quality, the painting can also be compared to the works on this theme by the painters Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, who also emphasized the classical features of Titian's painting.

Rosa Bonheur enjoyed great success at the Salon of 1853 with her painting The Horse Market, then at the Universal Exhibition of 1855 with La Fenaison en Auvergne. Henri d'Orléans, then in exile in England, continued to follow artistic trends in France and commissioned a painting from the artist for his wife Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. For this, he went through the Countess of Ségur. The Duke receives the finished work on June 5, 1864, in larger than expected dimensions. The painting appealed to the Duke and Duchess so much that he decided to pay double the agreed price, the sum of 10,000 francs instead of 5,000.[1]

The painting moved back to France when the Duke returned from exile in 1871, and was installed in the painting gallery of his Château de Chantilly, where it still hangs. The duke and the artist had the opportunity to meet afterwards during a dinner organized at the castle on April 22, 1894.[1]

Rosa Bonheur traveled to the Pyrenees several times. She brought back many drawings from her excursions.[2] The sheep represented in this painting are characteristic of the Basque-Béarnaise breed.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q97667173,"The Miraculous Draught of Fishes is a circa 1618–1620 oil painting depicting a New Testament episode,  by the Flemish artist Jacob Jordaens. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 618.[2]

The painting was long assumed to be by Peter Paul Rubens, who had treated similar subjects involving the fisherman Simon Peter. Wilhelm von Bode bought it as a Rubens (in London, in 1911), and the Rubens specialist Justus Müller-Hofstede confirmed that attribution in 1969. Only in 1977 did a consensus emerge among art historians that the painting is a work from the end of the early period of the long-lived Jacob Jordaens's career. This was established on compositional as well as chromatic grounds.[1]

The purpose of the painting has never been satisfactorily established. It is too large for an oil sketch, and too rough for an official commission. It may be a modello for a lost, larger and more polished painting, or for a tapestry. It could also have been destined for a predella.[2][1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23904,"Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata is a panel painting in tempera by the Italian artist Giotto, painted around 1295–1300 for the Church of Saint Francis in Pisa and it is now in the Musée du Louvre in Paris. It shows an episode from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, and is 314 cm high (to the top of the triangule) by 162 cm wide. It is signed OPUS IOCTI FLORENTINI (""Work of Florentine Giotto""). 

In his Le Vite, Giorgio Vasari mentions the work in a transept chapel of the church of San Francesco in Pisa. Despite having been disputed, the work is now generally recognized to be by Giotto, being also signed; it has been dated from shortly before or after the Stories of St. Francis in Assisi, around 1295–1300.

In 1813 it became property of the Louvre (inv. 309), as part of the Napoleonic looting of art in Italy, together with Cimabue's Maestà, also from San Francesco. Jean Baptise Henraux took it, due to the interest of Dominique Vivant Denon, who was particularly passionate about ""primitive"" Italian paintings. It was put on display in the Louvre in 1814. After the restitution of artworks seized at the time, the great panel was one of the paintings that remained in France.

The work has a rectangular shape in the lower part, ending with a triangular cusp, and has a gold ground. It depicts St. Francis receiving the stigmata during his prayer on Mount Alverno from a flying Christ who appears to him as a seraphim. The latter's wounds emit light rays which strike Francis' body. The background is a mix of newer and old elements, the latter including the very generic mountains and the lack of proportions in the landscape elements. The chapels in the mount show the attempt to draw them according to geometrical perspective. Francis' face is characterized by a strong use of chiaroscuro.

The scene was innovative as it abandoned the Italo-Byzantine tradition of inexpressive figures as the center of paintings in favor of a moment of action as the principal subject (compare the works of Bonaventura Berlinghieri and the Master of San Francesco Bardi, or Giotto's own Badia Polyptych).

At the left and right corners, the heraldry of the Ughi or Cinquini family is visible.

The predella shows three scenes from the saint's life: The Dream of Pope Innocent III, The Approval of the Franciscan Rule, and The Sermon to the Birds.[1] These depictions are also generally attributed to Giotto, and are strongly tied to the frescoes of Assisi. The panel is signed OPUS IOCTI FLORENTINI (""The work of Giotto of Florence"").

The Dream shows the collapse of Laterano, with its church tilting and a column just breaking. The presence of Saint Peter to indicate that the Pope is sleeping during the vision was an innovative technique at the time. The Approval, on the other hand, is very similar to Giotto's fresco in the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi  Innocence III Confirms the Franciscan Order and is placed in a similar room with arches and shelves to create perspective. The Sermon stands out for its simplicity and abstraction, thanks to its gold background without decorations. 

In general, the style of the scenes shows greater Gothic elegance than the three stories of the Fransciscan cycle in Giotto's Assisi frescoes and serves as a point of comparison to Giottesque artists such as the Master of St Cecilia.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42305169,"Portrait of Napoleon III, or initially called in French Portrait de S. M. l'Empereur[1] (Portrait of His Majesty the Emperor) is an oil painting of 1861 by the French painter Hippolyte Flandrin, depicting France's Emperor Napoleon III standing in his Grand Cabinet. It is held at the Musée de l'Histoire de France, in Paris. At its first presentation in the Universal Exhibition in 1862, the painting attracted praise for its true-to-life representation of Napoleon III.

In 1853, the newly-appointed Emperor of the French Napoleon III commissioned Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, a pupil of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and specialized painter of religious figures, to work on a standing portrait of him.[2] The Emperor, displeased by Flandrin's depiction of him, cancelled the commission, and preferred Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting of him in his coronation robes, with its more glorified and distinguished idealization. Reinstated in 1861, Flandrin recommenced work on his portrait, incentivized by a retrospective commission of 20,000 francs.[3]

According to Karine Huguenaud, Flandrin's portrait is a ""penetrating psychological study of the emperor"", extraordinarily capturing Napoleon III's ""distant and inscrutable look"".[2] Standing in his Général de Division uniform,[4] Napoleon III is depicted in the Grand Cabinet at the Tuileries Palace amidst pointed attributes: a marble bust of Napoleon Bonaparte, crowned with laurel, over his right shoulder and a Napoleonic eagle in the background.[5] On his desk are French maps and a copy of Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico.[3] ""This"", exulted writer Théophile Gautier, ""is without doubt the first 'real' portrait which we have of Your Majesty"", referring to the realistic approach in Flandrin's work.[3]

The Portrait of Napoleon III was first shown at the 1862 Universal Exhibition in London, on donation from the Emperor. Flandrin's painting was a standout wherever it was exhibited: the Universal Exhibition, Paris Salon (1863), at the Paris Ecole des Beaux-Arts (1864), and the Paris Exposition universelle (1867).[3] The critics were positive: the sincerity of the subject exercised both intimacy and fascination, winning favor over Winhalter's coronation portrait. By 1884, Flandrin's painting was returned to the French government and displayed in the Palace of Versailles.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3612419,"The Allegory of Virtue is an oil on canvas painting by Correggio dating to around 1531 and measuring 149 by 88 cm.[1] It and Allegory of Vice were painted as a pair for the studiolo of Isabella d'Este, with Vice probably the second of the two to be completed. This hypothesis is since only one (possibly non-autograph) sketch survives for Vice, unlike Virtue, for which two preparatory studies survive (in the Louvre), along with a near-complete oil sketch (attributed to Correggio in the 1603 inventory of the Aldobrandini collection and now at the Galleria Doria Pamphili) - this suggests Correggio had become more proficient after the difficult gestation of Virtue.[2]

As usually interpreted, the central woman is Minerva, holding a read lance and a plumed helmet - the work may even be a continuation of Mantegna's 1502 Triumph of the Virtues, painted for the same studiolo and also featuring a Minerva with a red lance. (Others have interpreted the figure as Isabella herself, dressed as Wisdom.) Glory hovers above her holding a crown, whilst a seated female figure to the left is surrounded by symbols of the four cardinal virtues (a snake in her hair for Prudence, a sword for Justice, reins for temperance and Hercules's lion skin for Fortitude). Some interpret the seated black female figure on the right as Astrology, Science or Intellectual Virtue - she points outside the painting's space and thus (like the putto in Vice) draws the viewer's attention from one painting to the other. 

After the studiolo's contents was dispersed, Virtue and the Mantegna were given to cardinal Richelieu around 1627 and moved to Paris. There they were acquired by Eberhard Jabach in 1671, before being sold by him to Louis XIV - Virtue still hangs in the Louvre.[3][4]

Marie Antoinette with a Rose, also known as Marie-Antoinette with the Rose (French: Marie-Antoinette dit « à la Rose ») is an oil painting by the French artist Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. It was painted in 1783, and is in the collection of the Palace of Versailles. As of November 2022 it is hanging in the ante-dining room of the Petit Trianon.

Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, the court painter of Queen Marie Antoinette of France, painted Marie Antoinette with a Rose in 1783, six years prior to the outbreak of French Revolution and ten years prior to the eventual beheading of Louis XVI and the queen. Vigée Le Brun was enrolled at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 31 May 1783 and in the same year she was commissioned by Marie Antoinette to present a portrait of herself for the upcoming Salon.[2] She portrayed the queen wearing a dress that looked like a chemise. The chemise-like dress was adapted from the Parisian fashion dressmaker Rose Bertin, the queen's favourite, during the time when the queen lived at the Petit Trianon, out of the palace. Visitors to the Salon were shocked because they thought it unbecoming to portray a queen of France in this kind of dress. 
It was also made of imported cotton instead of supporting the struggling French silk industry.[3] 
After that, the portrait was removed from the Salon.[2]

Vigée Le Brun immediately painted a new portrait to be exhibited before the event ended.[4] The pose did not change in the new portrait. The queen is dressed in a classic blue-grey silk dress with a large striped ribbon bow and rich pearl jewelry, which were considered more suitable for a queen of France.[5] The artist intentionally portrayed the queen in a silk dress to show the queen's support for the silk-weavers of Lyon.[2]

The first portrait, in a chemise, seems to have been lost, but the artist produced five subsequent versions with variations in costume, for example with a hat or in a muslin dress.[6]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q965822,"The Madonna della Vittoria is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna; the painting was executed in 1496.

On 6 July 1495 the French army of Charles VIII of France, retreating from Italy after the French Invasion of 1494-1498, fought the Italic League at the Battle of Fornovo.  The League, commanded by Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua, was made up of numerous nation-states determined to prevent French dominance in Italy, and included the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Venice, Milan, and the Papal States controlled by Pope Alexander VI. Despite the League failing in its goal to destroy the French army, taking more casualties at Fornovo, and allowing Charles VIII to retreat back to France with his army intact,[1] Francesco claimed victory.[a][2] As a sign of his self-proclaimed victory at Fornovo, he commissioned Mantegna to paint the Madonna della Vittoria.[3]

During Francesco's absence from Mantua, Daniele da Norsa, a Jewish banker, had purchased a house in the city's San Simone quarter and replaced the image of the Virgin Mary which decorated its façade with his own coat of arms. The regent, Sigismondo Gonzaga, ordered him to restore the depiction. Although Daniele agreed to do so, the populace, inflamed by anti-semitic feeling, destroyed his house.[citation needed]

When Francesco returned, he forced Daniele to fund a chapel and a devotional painting. The painting was to be executed by the Mantuan court painter, Mantegna, and was inaugurated in 1496 on the anniversary of the duke's victory at Fornovo. The work was placed in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, which had been constructed over the ruins of Daniele da Norsa's house.[citation needed]

The painting was one of the artworks looted by the French during the Napoleonic invasion of Italy, and by 1798 was being exhibited in the Louvre. The painting was never returned; the given excuse was that its large size made the transport difficult. The presence of a sulphur-crested cockatoo in the painting is considered as evidence of Arab trade in the Australasian region with the bird being a gift from Sultan al-Kamil to Frederick II.[4]

The altarpiece shows Francesco Gonzaga paying homage to Mary, who sits on a high throne decorated with marbles intarsias and bas-reliefs. The base of the throne, with lion paws, has, within a medallion, the inscription ""REGINA/CELI LET./ALLELVIA"" (Queen of Heaven, rejoice, Alleluia); it lies on a circular basement with a bas-relief of the ""Original Sin"" and other stories from the Book of Genesis which are partly obscured by the praying figures. The throne's back has a large solar disc, decorated with weavings and vitreous pearls.

The child Jesus, who holds two red flowers (symbols of the Passion) and Mary look at Francesco Gonzaga, who is kneeling and has a grateful and smiling expression while receiving their blessing. The protection given to Gonzaga during the battle is also symbolized by Mary's mantle, which partially covers his head. Opposite to the donor are St. John the Baptist with a cross featuring the usual cartouche saying ""ECCE/AGNVS/DEI ECCE/Q[VI] TOLL/IT P[ECCATA] M[VNDI]"" (Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the world), and his mother, St. Elizabeth, protector of Isabella d'Este, wife of Francesco Gonzaga. The choice of St. Elizabeth in the place of a patron may have been chosen as a message of judgement to the Norsa who were made to pay for the work as a penalty for removing an image of the Madonna from their home.  Unlike the Norsa, St. Elizabeth who is represented as a Jewess in a yellow turban, was said to be the first to recognize the sanctity of Mary.[5]

At the sides are two couples of standing saints: in the foreground are two military saints, the archangel St. Michael with a sword and St. Longinus with a broken spear, donning richly decorated armors; behind them are St. Andrew, patron saint of Mantua, with a long stick with the cross and St. George, another military saint, with a helmet and a long red lance.

The scene is set in an apse formed by a pergola of leaves, flowers and fruits, with several birds; the pergola's frame has at the top a shell (an attribute of the Virgin as new Venus), from which hang threads of coral pearls and rock crystal, as well as a large piece of red coral, another hint to the Passion of Jesus. The parrot is a comment on the birth of Jesus.[6]

In 1900, the year of this painting, he embarked on two major projects—a series of the River Thames in London and another series of his water gardens in Giverny, including some of his famous paintings of waterlilies, such as The Waterlily Pond (now in the Museum of Fine Arts Boston).

His dealer Durand-Ruel exhibited recent works, including a dozen Waterlilies[2] and he bought his friend Renoir's painting Mosque (Arabian Festival).[2]


Monet worked on and developed the garden that is the subject of the painting from the end of 1883 until the end of his life. 
It was essentially a garden of perennials, highlighted by annuals. Monet established a number of basic principles to which he always adhered: bare earth was anathema to him; he avoided dark flowers; conversely, he could never get enough of blue ... he abhored single flowers, permitting double blooms only in roses and herbaceous peonies; and he loathed variegated foliage.[4]

The Angelus (French: L'Angélus) is an oil painting by French painter Jean-François Millet, completed between 1857 and 1859.

The painting depicts two peasants bowing in a field over a basket of potatoes to say a prayer, the Angelus, that together with the ringing of the bell from the church on the horizon marks the end of a day's work.[1]

Millet was commissioned by the American would-be painter and art collector Thomas Gold Appleton, who never came to collect it. The painting is famous today for driving the prices for artworks of the Barbizon school up to record amounts in the late 19th century.

Millet said: ""The idea for The Angelus came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed.""[2] Completed between 1857 and 1859, it is an oil painting on canvas. When Appleton failed to take possession, Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, Prayer for the Potato Crop, to The Angelus.

It depicts two peasants during the potato harvest in Barbizon, with a view of the church tower of Chailly-en-Bière. At their feet is a small basket of potatoes, and around them a cart and a pitchfork. Various interpretations of the relationship between the two peasants have been made, such as colleagues at work, husband and wife pair, or (as Gambetta interpreted it) farmer and maidservant. An 1889 sales catalogue described them simply as ""a young peasant and his companion."" Millet sold The Angelus after his The Gleaners was sold at the Salon in 1857. About half the size, it brought him less than half the amount for which he sold The Gleaners. The Angelus was eventually shown the year before Millet's death in Brussels in 1874, where it was greatly admired by Léon Gambetta.[1]

Much later, Salvador Dalí saw a print of this painting in his school and insisted that this was a funeral scene, not a prayer ritual and that the couple were portrayed praying and mourning over their dead infant. Although this was an unpopular view, at his insistence the Louvre X-rayed the painting, showing a small painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin by the basket.[3] It seems possible that Millet originally painted a burial – perhaps a rural version of Courbet's famous painting A Burial at Ornans (1850) – but then converted it to a recitation of the Angelus, complete with a visible church bell tower.

At first, the painting was interpreted as a political statement, with Millet viewed as a socialist in solidarity with the workers.
While the painting expresses a profound sense of religious devotion, and became one of the most widely reproduced religious paintings of the 19th century, with prints displayed by thousands of devout householders across France, Millet painted it from a sense of nostalgia rather than from any strong religious feeling. According to Karine Huguenaud, ""There is, however, no religious message to the painting: Millet was simply concerned with portraying a ritualised moment of meditation taking place as the dusk rolls in.""[4] In 1864 Belgian minister Jules Van Praët exchanged it for Millet's Bergère avec son troupeau (Shepherd and her flock) and commented dryly, ""What can I say? It is clearly a masterpiece, but faced with these two peasants, whose work is interrupted by prayer, everyone thinks they can hear the nearby church bell tolling, and in the end, the constant ringing just became tiresome"".[4]

The painting triggered a rush of patriotic fervour when the Louvre tried to buy it in 1889, and was vandalized by a madman in 1932.[2]

With reference to the Musée d'Orsay, the provenance of the work is as follows; although some events are missing, such as the Brussels show in 1874:[5]

A month after the Secretan sale, The Gleaners was sold for 300,000 francs, and the contrast between the auction prices of Millet's paintings on the art market and the value of Millet's estate for his surviving family led to the droit de suite (French for ""right to follow""), a French law that compensates artists or their heirs when artworks are resold.

The imagery of The Angelus with peasants praying was a popular sentimental 19th-century religious subject.  Generations later, Salvador Dalí had seen a reproduction of it on the wall of his childhood school and claimed to have been spooked by the painting. He felt the basket looked like the coffin of a child and the woman looked like a praying mantis. He was inspired to create his paranoiac-critical paintings The Architectonic Angelus of Millet and Gala and the Angelus of Millet Preceding the Imminent Arrival of the Conical Anamorphoses in 1933. These were followed two years later by a similar pair of paintings which included a partial reproduction of Millet's The Angelus, called The Angelus of Gala and Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's Angelus. In 1938, he published a book Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet.[8]

In 2018, Gil Baillie[9] wrote that The Angelus incorporates a sensibility of the sacramental that made reproductions of the painting especially popular in Western Europe throughout much of the remainder of the 19th century. He incorporates a story that illustrates the role of imagination in the appeal of the image: ""When his lifelong friend and agent Alfred Sensier first saw the painting on Millet’s easel, the artist asked: 'Well, what do you think of it?' 'It’s the Angelus,' acknowledged Sensier. To which Millet replied: 'Can you hear the bells?'"" Baillie, acknowledging the effect of The Angelus on Dali's art, suggests that the latter artist's reaction is a manifestation of the sacramental meaning of the piece.

In Jean-Pierre Melville's French drama film Léon Morin, Priest (1961) there is a scene in which a conversation between the atheist French widow Barny (Emmanuelle Riva) and the priest Léon Morin (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is interrupted by the sound of church bells. Barny in her first-person narration states, ""The Angelus rang. He'd have to enact a scene from a Millet painting or not answer the call of the church. Appear ridiculous or inadequate."" Morin proceeds to pray the Angelus in front of Barny.

The painting can also be frequently seen on the Taylor family's living room wall in several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show.

The Pilgrims at Emmaus (French: Les Pèlerins d'Emmaüs), also called the Supper at Emmaus, is a painting by Titian, made about 1533 or 1534, which hangs in the Louvre in Paris.

The date of this picture has been debated. Crowe and Cavalcaselle put it down to the year 1547 (about); Gronau and Ricketts think it was painted somewhat earlier, about 1543.[1][2] The Louvre dates it even earlier, to between 1533 and 1534.[3] It belonged to the group of Mantuan pictures bought in 1628 by Charles I. It entered the collections of Iabach and Louis XIV. In the eighteenth century it was in the sacristy of the Chapel at Versailles. A replica, which, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century was preserved in the Ducal Palace, Venice, belongs now to the Earl of Yarborough.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3612413,"The Allegory of Vice is an oil on canvas painting by Correggio dating to around 1531 and measuring 149 cm (59 in) by 88 cm (35 in).[1]

This picture and the Allegory of Virtue were painted as a pair for the studiolo of Isabella d'Este, with Vice probably the second of the two to be completed. This hypothesis is since only one (possibly non-autograph) sketch survives for Vice, unlike Virtue, for which several preparatory studies survive, along with a near-complete under-drawing – this suggests Correggio had become more proficient after the difficult gestation of Virtue.[2]

Influenced by the Laocoon (as is Correggio's treatment of Saint Roch in his San Sebastiano Madonna and Four Saints), the central male figure is sometimes identified as a personification of Vice but sometimes as Silenus (possibly from Virgil's Eclogues 6, where a sleeping Silenus is tied up by the shepherds Chromi and Marsillo and forced to sing by them and the nymph Egle) or Vulcan. It was even misidentified as Apollo and Marsyas by the writer of the Gonzaga collection inventory of 1542. This misunderstanding may have contributed to an Apollo and Marsyas (actually by the studio or circle of Bronzino) being historically misattributed to Correggio.[3] The putto in the foreground is influenced by Raphael's putti in the Sistine Chapel.

In 1542, after Isabella's death, they were both recorded as hanging on either side of the entrance door ""in the Corte Vecchia near the grotto"", with Vice on the left and Virtue on the right. After the contents of her studiolo were dispersed, it remained in Mantua at least until 1627, but the following year it was sold to Charles I of Great Britain. After his execution it was purchased by cardinal Mazarin in 1661 and later by the banker Everhard Jabach,[4] who later sold it to Louis XIV in Paris, reuniting it with Virtue. They both now hang in the Louvre.[5]

The Pink Dress (La robe rose) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Frédéric Bazille, produced in 1864 when he was aged 23. The work is now in the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris.[1]

The dimensions of the canvas, kept at the Musée d'Orsay, are a height of 147 cm by a width of 110 cm.[2]

The painting is an en plein air painting of Bazille's cousin Thérèse des Hours, sitting on the stone ledge around the family property of Le Domaine de Méric in Montpellier, facing the village of Castelnau-le-Lez in the Hérault department of southern France.  The Bazille and des Hours families used to spend every summer on the estates which overlooked the village. Thérèse is sitting on the  terrace at the far end of the garden, facing away from the viewer. She is wearing a dress with vertical pink and silver stripes, with a black apron. Bazille frames the middle ground with trees, a typical technique of the  Barbizon School, using darkness of the trees to direct the viewer's eye to the sun-drenched Midi village in the background.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15934792,"Project for the Transformation of the Grande Galerie du Louvre is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French painter Hubert Robert, made in 1796. It is held at the Louvre, in Paris. The Louvre acquired the painting in 1975; it is exhibited in the Sully wing, of the French paintings.[1]

The project for a museum for the Louvre Palace began in the last quarter of the 18th century. The first paintings were deposited there from the Palace of Versailles, in 1785.[2] The museum opened during the French Revolution in 1793; it only included a few hundred works, that were exhibited in the Grande Galerie along the Seine.

The painter Hubert Robert was appointed keeper of the king's paintings in 1784 and was responsible for studying the layout of the future Grand Gallery, between 1784 and 1792, then between 1795 and 1802.[3] For the Salon of 1796, he imagined a view of the Gallery presenting the arrangements he believed were necessary, in particular the opening of glass roofs allowing overhead lighting of the works.[4]

The painting is an oil painting on rectangular canvas of 115 by 145 cm. It depicts in detail an imaginary view of the Grande Galerie du Louvre, in Paris. The Gallery features overhead lighting and is segmented into bays by series of double Corinthian columns and transverse arches. It contains numerous works of art: paintings displayed side by side along the walls and sculptures erected in niches framed by pilasters or in the center of the space. A few visitors are present, including several copyists.[5]

Hubert Robert made several other paintings taking the Grande Galerie as a subject. They are development projects, descriptive paintings and even an imaginary view where he pictured it in ruins. He also painted two views of other parts of the Louvre: the Mars rotunda and the Arts counter. All these paintings are kept in the Louvre.[6]

The Improvised Field Hospital (French - L'ambulance improvisée) or Monet after His Accident at the Inn of Chailly is an oil-on-canvas painting created in 1865 by the French painter Frédéric Bazille. It shows Claude Monet in bed recovering from a leg injury he had sustained in summer 1865, in Chailly-en-Bière, small village just on the outskirts of the forest of Fontainebleau.[1][2] The work has been in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1986.

The Musée d'Orsay notes of the painting, ""Bazille, whose work falls between Courbet's Realism and a nascent Impressionism, renders the event in every detail. On the untidy bed one can clearly see the red, inflamed wound on Monet's shin, while his face expresses his despondency at being immobilised in this way. The intimacy of the scene demonstrates the bonds of friendship between the two men.""[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q783563,"The Sickness of Antiochus or Stratonice and Antiochus is an 1840 painting by the French artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It is now in the Musée Condé in Chantilly.[1]

The scene is one described in Plutarch's Life of Demetrius and also attested in the Bibliotheca historica of Diodorus Siculus, Lucian, Appian and Valerius Maximus. Antiochus was the son of Seleucus I Nicator. He fell in love with his father's new wife Stratonice of Syria, but kept this a secret despite falling mortally ill because of it. The doctor Erasistratus discovered the cause of Antiochus' sickness, since he became agitated and his heartbeat quickened when Stratonice entered the room. His father is thus shown collapsed at the foot of the bed.[2]

In 1834 Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans commissioned a painting from Ingres to act as a pendant to Paul Delaroche's 1834 The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (now also in the musée Condé). That same year Ingres left for Rome to take up his post as director of the French Academy. This delayed work on the commission, which began with a c.1838 sketch (now in the Cleveland Museum of Art). According to Lady Eglé Charlemont, she served as the model for Stratonice, Ingres' wife (Madeleine Chapelle) as the doctor, Hippolyte Flandrin for Antiochus' arms, and Ingres himself for Seleucus.

The painting was completed in Rome in 1840, with help from assistants: Victor Baltard, then studying architecture at the Academy, provided drawings for two of Ingres' pupils, Paul and Raymond Balze, to use in painting part of the architectural setting.[3] The Duke of Orléans was satisfied with the work and paid Ingres 6000 francs and commissioned a portrait from him. The painting was exhibited in the gallery at the Palais-Royal[4] and was inherited by the Duke of Orléans' widow Hélène de Mecklembourg-Schwerin on his death in 1842.

After the 1848 Revolution, the painting was sold in Paris in 1852, when it was acquired by the Demidoff family for 63,000 francs. It was sold again in Paris in 1863, where it was bought for 93,000 francs by Édouard Bocher, acting as intermediary for the Duke of Orléans' brother the Duke of Aumale, then in exile in London. Aumale exhibited it in the Salle de Tribune of his Château de Chantilly, where it still is.[5]

Ingres' teacher Jacques-Louis David had also painted the subject, in Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease, the painting which won him the Prix de Rome in 1774. Ingres had made several drawings after David's painting, the earliest dating to 1807.[2]

Another source may have been music and opera, since a lyre is shown in the foreground. The Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse produced Étienne-Nicolas Méhul's opera Stratonice several times whilst Ingres was a violinist with them. The painting shows the moment of the heroine's solo from Méhul's opera. The Assassination of the Duke of Guise was also based on an opera, Giacomo Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.[6]

The decor and dress are partly inspired by ancient models, with Stratonice in particular, very closely influenced by Roman sculpture. The bed is inspired by a 4th-century BC naiskos or funerary monument shown on a vase discovered at Canosa and published in 1816.[7]

Ingres produced at least four other versions of this subject:[8]

Les raboteurs de parquet (English title: The Floor Scrapers) is an oil painting by French Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte. The canvas measures 102 by 146.5 centimetres (40.2 in × 57.7 in). It was originally given by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the Musée du Luxembourg, then transferred to the Musée du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, and in 1986, it was transferred again to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed.[1]

Caillebotte's originality lays in his attempt to combine the careful drawing, modeling and exact tonal values encouraged by the Académie with vivid colors, bold perspectives, keen sense of natural light and modern subject matter of the Impressionist movement.[2] Painted in 1875, this work illustrates Caillebotte's continued interest in perspective and everyday life. In the scene, the observer stands above three workers on hands and knees, scraping a wooden floor in a bourgeois apartment—now believed to be Caillebotte's own studio at 77, rue de Miromesnil, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.[3] A window on the back wall admits natural light. The workers are all shown with nude torsos and tilted heads, suggesting a conversation.[4] Caillebotte's interest in the male nude, set in a modern context, has been linked to his presumed homosexuality, however it was part of a larger trend, not necessarily limited to homosexual artists, that was first introduced by Courbet in a painting of two wrestlers.[5] This is one of the first paintings to feature the urban working class.[6] It reintroduces the subject of the male nude in the painting, but in a strikingly updated form. Instead of the heroes of antiquity, here are the heroes of modern life—sinewy and strong—in stooped poses that would appear demeaning if they did not convey a sense of masculine strength and honest labor.[5] There is a motif of curls in the image, from the wood shavings on the floor, to the pattern of ironwork in the window grill to the arched backs and arms of the workers.[7] The repetition in the image, with the three workers engaged in different aspects of the same activity but having similar poses, is similar to works by Caillebotte's contemporary, Edgar Degas.[7]

Despite the effort Caillebotte put into the painting, it was rejected by France's most prestigious art exhibition, the Salon, in 1875. The depiction of working-class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a ""vulgar subject matter"".[6] He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, with whom he had already associated himself, in 1876.[8] He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a second, different version of Raboteurs from 1876, and his earlier work Jeune homme à sa fenêtre (Young Man at His Window)[9] The images of the floor scrapers came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as ""vulgar"".[9]

The painting divided opinion in Paris art circles. Among the detractors, Emile Porchoron, a critic of Impressionism, damned Caillebotte with faint praise: ""the least bad of the exhibition. One of the missions Impressionism seems to have set for itself is to torture perspective: you see here what results can be obtained.""[10] Émile Zola praised the technical execution, but then called it ""an anti-artistic painting, painting as neat as glass, bourgeois painting, because of the exactitude of the copying.""[11] Louis Énault was not troubled by the depiction (""The subject matter is certainly vulgar, but we can understand how it might tempt a painter"") but did find fault with the image's fidelity to the scene: ""I only regret that the artist did not choose his types better... The arms of the planers are too thin, and their chests too narrow... may your nude be handsome or don't get involved with it!""[12]

The painting received praise from many critics, though. Regarding the Salon rejection, poet and critic Émile Blémont called the decision ""[a] very bad mark for the official jurors"".[12] Marius Chaumelin compared Caillebotte favorably to his contemporaries, writing that the work showed that he was ""a realist just as raw, but much more witty, than Courbet, just as violent, but altogether more precise, than Manet.""[13] Philippe Burty made comparisons to an even earlier generation of artists: ""His pictures are original in their composition, but, more than that, so energetic as to drawing that they resemble the early Florentines.""[12]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12060616,"Hunting (or Hunting Scene) is a painting by Italian artist Annibale Carracci, painted before 1595 and given to Louis XIV by Prince Camillo Pamphili in 1665.  It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris.

The painting and its companion, Fishing, were included in Charles Le Brun's inventory in 1683, and in November 1695 they were in the apartments of King Louis XIV's younger brother. It was no doubt for this purpose that they were given two sumptuous gilt frames, each with attributes suited to the subject of the painting – among the finest examples of the art of frame-making in the time of Louis XIV. In 1955, when the varnish was being cleaned, the 19th century gilding covering the original gilding was removed – a task of some magnitude which was carried out by the French firm of Lebrun.[1]

This work, together with its companion, date from Carracci's Bolognese period, before he left for Rome in 1595 to paint at the Galleria Farnese. At this time he was extremely interested in landscape, and his experiments are a foreshadowing of Poussin's classical compositions; but in these pictures he is exploring in a different direction, in the tradition of the Bassani, a family of painters whose studios continued to turn out landscapes which were prized all over Europe. His interest was the countryside. Without any religious theme as pretext, he painted two pure landscapes whose true subjects are the forest and the river, motivated by the themes of hunting and fishing. Therefore, Carracci was able to show nature animated with the life of the aristocracy and of ordinary people. The composition follows the visual device of division into compartments.[2]

Along with the Galleria Farnese, these two thematic paintings are among Carracci's masterpieces, and have always been much admired by artists. Manet found inspiration in the Fishing, and the Hunting has been copied by Matisse, Edvard Munch and Rouault.[3]

A Young Tiger Playing with its Mother is a painting of 1830–31 by French artist Eugène Delacroix depicting two enormous tigers ""playing"" with each other. Painted early in his career, it shows how the artist was attracted to animal subjects in this period.[1] The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1831, and archives of Delacroix's will executor, Achille Piron, revealed that the painter had paid 1,200 francs to insure it.[2] It belonged to M. Maurice Cottier and now is on display at Room 77 of Louvre in Paris.

Sweetly, the young background tiger slopes in his mother in the foreground, both running into rocks and under a cloudy sky. Some authors have written that Delacroix's animals paintings were made using his pet cat as a model.[3] And although it seems that the painting inspiration is due to one of his visits to the Jardin des Plantes zoo to see the tigers play with his friend Antoine-Louis Barye (an animal sculptor), Delaroix was always more content to observe his own cat.[4]

The piece was in some way influenced by Rubens and is very opposite of Delacroix's violent Tiger Hunt, both (and others Delacroix painting in this subject) capturing the ferocity and tenderness that these animals are capable of.[4] Delacroix could paint two different works that shows a discrepancy of the tigers behavior. In fact, tiger cubs play in their first years of life because it prepares them for hunting, stalking, climbing and fighting in the grown phase.[5] Tigers and great cats are frequent motifs in Eugène's works (see the following section).

These paintings, along with A Young Tiger Playing with its Mother, can be interpreted as a form of the artist displaying human emotions and passions personified as tame and fierce animals. For example, Delacroix wrote in his Journal of the time: ""Men are tigers and wolves driven to destroy one another"".[6] His friend Théophile Gautier saw a resemblance between him and manner and those of these great cats that he painted, writing: ""His tawny eyes, with their feline expression, his slender lips stretched tight over magnificent teeth, his firm jaw line emphasised by strong cheekbones... gave his features an untamed, a strange, exotic, almost alarming beauty.""[4]

In French, the picture is called Jeune tigre jouant avec sa mère. Its fierce but also divinely animals represents the ""delight in wildness"" that Romantic artists like Delacroix was fascinated with.[7] (His interest in wildlife reaches its peak with Ovid among the Scythians (1859) — where there's no feline, but barbarians people.) The painting of the mother and son tigers had a significant history to painter's works and to the time, as Lee Johnson wrote about it:

""A Young Tiger Playing with its Mother, Delacroix's largest animal painting to date, is shown at an exhibition in the Palais du Luxembourg for the benefit of citizens wounded in the July Revolution.""[8]

Moreau often painted and drew horses during his Romantic period and was probably encouraged to do so by Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy, whose favourable opinion had decided the young painter's career.[7][8]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17190956,"Cupid Crowned by Psyche or Psyche Crowning Cupid is a 1785-1790 oil on canvas painting by Jean-Baptiste Greuze, now in the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille. It shows a scene from the myth of Cupid and Psyche, with a figure of Modesty standing behind Psyche and two cupids in the background placing rose crowns on a bed and throwing incense on a tripod.[1]

The work represents a return to the classical themes Greuze had abandoned after the poor reception for his The Emperor Severus Reproaching His Son Caracalla (1769). He began the work around the same time as he was commissioned to paint Innocence Led Captive by Love, another scene involving Cupid, by the comte d'Artois. However, Cupid Crowned remained incomplete, possibly due to the onset of the French Revolution, and was only exhibited publicly upon the death of the artist's daughter and heir Caroline Greuze in 1842. It was sold the following year and passed through several hands before reaching its present home in 1873 as part of a bequest by Alexandre Leleux.[2]

The painting illustrates an episode from the myth of Psyche, a young mortal who attracted the jealousy of Aphrodite. She sends her son, Eros, god of love, to shoot her one of his arrows and the young girl falls in love with the ugliest of creatures. But it is Eros who falls under her spell and ends up marrying her. In the episode represented, Psyche is seated and is about to lay her white crown of purity on the forehead of kneeling Eros. Behind her, Modesty turns away while, in the background, a love places two wreaths of roses on the bed and another throws incense into an incense burner.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3210253,"Magdalene with the Smoking Flame (also titled in French La Madeleine à la veilleuse, and La Madeleine à la flamme filante) is a c. 1640 oil-on-canvas depiction of Mary Magdalene by French Baroque painter Georges de La Tour. Two versions of this painting exist, one in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art[1] and the other in the Louvre Museum (La Madeleine a la veilleuse).[2]

The Louvre version of the painting was bought in 1949 from the French Administration des Douanes.[citation needed] In the somewhat uncertain chronology of Georges de La Tour's work, this painting has been allotted the date of 1640, by analogy with the Saint Mary with a Mirror, which has been dated between 1635 and 1645.[citation needed] The location of this painting before 1949 is unknown.

Georges de La Tour was a Catholic Baroque artist with a successful career, despite the fact that he was working at an unsettling time of religious wars and the violence that followed. He learned many skills from the work of Caravaggio such as tenebrism, an especially dramatic contrast between light and shadow. Like Caravaggio, in Georges de La Tour's younger days he was interested in low-life disreputable scenes of hoaxers, thieves, and swindlers. Unlike Caravaggio, Georges de La Tour was not violent or a murderer. His artwork is known to be thoughtful, genuine, and sincere.[1]

He painted many versions of the Magdalene, which suggests that several of his patrons were interested in this theme.[1] Throughout his Magdalene series he demonstrates small changes in lighting, pose, and symbolism. Although the changes are small, the paintings seem to portray a number of different meanings and emotions.[3]

By the 1620s, La Tour was offered substantial court patronage in Lorraine and royal patronage in Paris. In the 1630s, during the Thirty Years War, La Tour spent time in Paris painting for Cardinal Richelieu. He also painted for King Louis XIII and presented him with a Night Scene with Saint Sebastian. He was then titled painter-in-ordinary to the king.[4]

During the 17th century, great devotion was shown to Mary Magdalene in all Catholic countries. She was the perfect lover of Christ, her beauty was made more appealing because of her repentance, which had a special attraction for a period so passionately interested in problems of mysticism, quietism and asceticism.[2] The theme of the repentance of sinners and trials sent by God is illustrated in subjects such as the Repentance of St. Peter, Mary Magdalene, and Job. A number of written works give evidence to the cult of Magdalene and this cult became widespread since Provence contained two great sanctuaries dedicated to her: the grotto of La Sainte-Baume, and the Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.[2]

After being introduced to Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene became one of Christ's most devoted followers. Mary Magdalene became a symbol of the sacrament of penance and contemplation.[4] In Baroque art, Mary Magdalene is usually shown beneath Christ's feet because according to interpretations of the Bible, she was a prostitute who washed Jesus's feet using her hair and tears. She is also known to have witnessed Jesus's crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. In paintings, she is usually recognized as a saint with a halo above her head and she often holds an ointment jar.[5]

In the Baroque era, the image of Mary Magdalene went through a change. If the medieval Magdalene was shown as a former sinner who was saved through salvation, Mary Magdalene during the Counter-Reformation was depicted as beguilingly seductive.[5] Like other saints, Mary Magdalene was often used as propaganda for the Catholic sacraments. For example, Francesco Vanni's painting, The Last Communion of Mary Magdalene, shows the practice of communion with a dying woman, which made a statement about the triumph of the Catholic faith against disagreements with Protestantism.[6]

The Magdalene with the Smoking Flame portrays Mary Magdalene with a skull on her lap and a brightly lit candle on the desk. She has her hand under her chin while staring at the candle. There are two books placed on the desk, like the books in the other versions of the paintings. One of the books is the Holy Bible. There is also a cross and a rope on top of the desk. The rope looks similar to the rope that is tied around her waist. Her shoulders are bare and her skirt only reaches to her knees leaving her legs bare.[3]

Georges de La Tour paints Magdalene with her hand tucked under her chin, contemplating death with the slight touch of the skull with her other hand.[3] In the Magdalene with the Smoking Flame there is no mirror in the painting compared to Magdalene at the Mirror and Magdalene with Two Flames. The Magdalene in this painting is not monochrome like the other versions.

Most of Georges de La Tour's paintings were influenced by Caravaggio and his followers from Rome. Caravaggio's followers spread throughout other European countries; therefore, it was not necessary for Georges de La Tour to travel to Italy. De La Tour was not only inspired by Caravaggio's style, but also by other northern styles.[6] He concentrated on dramatic effects of light and shade called tenebrism. Georges de La Tour took Caravaggio's style of tenebrism and made it into something new and entirely his own.[1] He created several monumental paintings that are different from both Italian art and Caravaggism. He brought many characteristics of mystery, tranquil grandeur, and silence into his artwork which brings it closer to French classical art and literature.[7]

There are two other works on the same theme by de La Tour.

Magdalene at the Mirror (National Gallery of Art) is an oil on-canvas painting created circa 1635–1640. This version is known to be the original painting out of the Magdalene series. In Magdalene at the Mirror, Magdalene is shown in profile view sitting in front of the mirror, candle, and skull. The skull is on top of the Bible on the desk and the candle is covered by the skull. The viewer can only observe the top of the slightly shown candle and the light illuminating around it. The mirror shows the side of the skulls face yet the skull has its back towards the mirror.[4] The mirror symbolizes vanity while the skull is a metaphor of mortality.[8] The candlelight most likely stands for spiritual enlightenment. Martha with Magdalene at the Mirror was also painted by Caravaggio during the 16th century.[1]

Magdalene with Two Flames (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) is an oil-on-canvas painting created between 1625 and 1650. The exact date is unknown. The skull is placed on Magdalene's lap with her hands clasped over the head. The candle is brightly lit and is reflected within the mirror. The light from the candle illuminates throughout the room and on the wall where we see Magdalene's shadow.

The Wheel of Fortune is an oil painting on canvas by the British Pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones, made from 1875 to 1883.  The painting combines classical and medieval themes to present an allegory of the vagaries of life, a vanitas, with individual lives elevated or cast down as the wheel of fortune turns.  Burne-Jones commented: ""My wheel of Fortune is a true-to-life image; it comes to fetch each of us in turn, then it crushes us.""  The prime version has been in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1980.

The painting measures 200 cm × 100 cm (79 in × 39 in), with its frame, 259 cm × 151.5 cm (102.0 in × 59.6 in).  It employs a dull palette of greys, browns, greens and blues. It was originally conceived as part of the predella for an unrealised triptych on the Fall of Troy.

The tall frame is filled by a gigantic spoked wooden wheel, turned by a giant personification of the goddess Fortune standing in a contrapposto position, wrapped in the voluminous folds of a metallic blue classical gown, head swathed in a matching cloth, with closed eyes cast down.  Three smaller male nudes are being carried around by the wheel: at the top, a slave standing on the head of the second, a king with a crown and sceptre, and at the bottom the head and shoulders of a poet with laurel wreath, looking towards Fortune's feet.  The nude male figures were influenced by Michelangelo's paintings at the Sistine Chapel.  The wheel and the figures fill most of the composition, but fragments of a wall and a tree can be seen in the top left, with a small patch of grey sky.

The completed painting was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in London in 1883, and acquired that year by the politician Arthur Balfour, who later served as British Prime Minister and was created  1st Earl of Balfour in 1922.  It was exhibited at the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester in 1887, the Brussels International Exposition in 1897 and at a Burne-Jones exhibition at the New Gallery in London in 1898.

After Balfour's death in 1930, it was inherited by his brother, Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour, and sold in 1932 to the vicomte Charles de Noailles, who gave it to his daughter Nathalie de Noailles.  It was acquired by the French state in 1980, and allocated to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.

A second, smaller version in oils on canvas, painted from 1871 to 1885, is in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia.  Measuring 151.4 cm × 72.5 cm (59.6 in × 28.5 in), it was acquired as part of the Felton Bequest in 1909.  It is displayed in a heavy gilded tabernacle-style frame, a modern reconstruction based on fragments of the original, which has a decorative frieze with candelabrum ornament and egg and dart outer border, similar to those of other Burne-Jones paintings such as his Vespertina Quies (1893) in Tate Britain.

National Museum Cardiff has an unfinished version from about 1882, and preparatory sketches are in the Lady Lever Art Gallery.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1231009,"The Coronation of Napoleon[a] (French: Le Sacre de Napoléon) is a painting completed in 1807 by Jacques-Louis David, the official painter of Napoleon, depicting the coronation of Napoleon at Notre-Dame de Paris. The oil painting has imposing dimensions – it is almost 10 metres (33 ft) wide by a little over 6 metres (20 ft) tall. The work is on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris.

The work was commissioned by Napoleon orally in September 1804, and Jaques-Louis started work on it on 21 December 1805 in the former chapel of the College of Cluny, near the Sorbonne, which served as a workshop. Assisted by his student Georges Rouget, he put the finishing touches in January 1808.

From 7 February to 22 March 1808, the work was exhibited at the Salon annual painting display in 1808, and it was presented to the Salon decennial prize competition in 1810. The painting remained the property of David until 1819, when it was transferred to the Royal Museums, where it was stored in the reserves until 1837. Then, it was installed in the Chamber Sacre of the museum of the historical Palace of Versailles on the orders of King Louis-Philippe. In 1889, the painting was transferred to the Louvre from Versailles.

David was commissioned by American entrepreneurs to paint a full size replica, in 1808, immediately after the release of the original. He began work that year, painting it from memory, but didn't finish until 1822, during his exile in Brussels. The replica was eventually returned to France in 1947, to the original's place in the Palace of Versailles.[1]

The painting is a subject of The Public Viewing David's 'Coronation' at the Louvre, a painting by Louis-Léopold Boilly done in 1810, currently housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[2]

The composition is organized around several axes, and incorporates the rules of neoclassicism. One axis is that which passes through the cross and has a vertical orientation. A diagonal line runs from the pope to the empress. All eyes are turned towards Napoleon, who is the center of the composition.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19387846,"The Parca and the Angel of Death is an 1890 oil-on-canvas painting produced by the French Symbolist artist Gustave Moreau after the death of his companion Alexandrine Dureux. It is held at the Musée national Gustave Moreau, in Paris.

It shows the Moira or Parca Atropos leading the Angel of Death's black horse. The Angel holds a large sword and has a halo and red wings but no face.[1][2] In the background is a desolated landscape with a red moon and a waning glowing sun.[3]

The painting consists of large flows of paint, sometimes superimposed, sometimes ground up and thick.[4] A true meditation on death, produced just at the time Moreau retired from painting, its daring use of colour made it a precursor of fauvism fifteen years later, particularly the work of Georges Rouault, his pupil and the first curator of the musée Gustave-Moreau.[4][3]

From 1890 onwards Moreau retired and produced works of a more autobiographical character, such as The Parca.[2] His ""best and only friend Alexandrine Dureux had died and he painted the work in his memory at the same time as Orpheus Weeping Upon Eurydice's Tomb[1][5] In Heures, Francis Poictevin wrote of the work:

At the summit of a moor at the foot of which rises a cadaverous moon, a moon of an evil hour, a horse mounted by the angel of death, some skinned obscure figure, seemingly skinless, a bloody candle in his hand, this shadowy horse, the fevered eye, the head turning quivering and begging strangely towards its guide, a suspicious looking old woman buried in her mantle, as he advances slightly magically with his quickset bridle, above all sniffing the abyss all around him
The work evokes the idea of grief.[2] Atropos, the most terrible of the three Parcae, was the one who cut the thread of life,[1] while the Angel of Death could well be one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.[1] Moreau thus mixes pagan and Christian traiditions in a perfect syncretism typical of his painting.[1][6] As often in Moreau's work, nature is empathetic, with the setting sun an evocation of death.[7] His treatment is almost expressionist, especially in its use of black, the quick and scraped application of paint and the reddening tones.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3605548,"Adoration of the Shepherds is a painting by Luca Giordano, executed c. 1688, and commissioned for the queen's apartments in the Palacio Real in Madrid, or perhaps at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, near Madrid.  It was produced at the same time as the same artist's Marriage of the Virgin, as part of a set of paintings of the Life of the Virgin intended for the queen's bedroom. Both works are now in the Louvre in Paris.[1]

The painting shows the Virgin Mary holding the Baby Jesus in her arms, while Joseph is standing next to her, on the right side of the picture. Several cherubs, admiring the Holy Family illuminated by a strong beam of light, are placed on the left side in an elevated position in respect to it. A group of shepherds always approaches from the left bringing gifts as a sign of adoration for the Baby Jesus. The standing shepherd placed in the foreground of the others gives the composition a sense of dynamism, while the shepherd kneeling with his arms crossed on the chest creates an atmosphere of contemplation.

It was in the Spanish royal collection until Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte (1768-1844) was installed as King of Spain.  He gave the pair to a French general, since when they have been in France.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57285436,"Le Sentier des douanes is a Pointillist-divisionist[1] oil on canvas painting by Paul Signac, measuring 72 by 92.5 cm. It shows the 'Sentier des Douanes', a seaside path in Saint-Tropez. The work now hangs in the musée de Grenoble, to which it was left in 1923 by Georgette Agutte and Marcel Sembat.[1][2]

Signac produced several crayon, ink and watercolour preparatory sketches, before producing an initial version of the painting in 1902. In summer 1904 he travelled to Saint-Tropez, where he worked with Matisse.[3] He produced the final work in his studio in 1905, the year Fauvism was born. For a time it was known as Saint-Tropez or Le sentier côtier, but he settled on Le Sentier des douanes as its final title in 1905.

It demonstrates the artist's identification with the Pointillist movement in his choice to use different brushstrokes to show different falls of light – oblique ones for the slopes of the hill, vertical ones for the trees and horizontal ones for the sky and sea[3] – altogether allowing him to give a dynamic effect to all the spaces shown.

Captivated by the light and colours of a sunset, he contrasted the blue-violet tones of the sea and shadows with pink-oranges of the earth and the tree trunks.[4] The work also highlights his attempts to show the quay as faithfully as possible by using preparatory drawings and sketches.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q798034,"Bacchus, originally Saint John the Baptist, is a painting in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, France, based on a drawing by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci. It is presumed to have been executed by an unknown follower, perhaps in Leonardo's workshop. Sydney J. Freedberg assigns the drawing to Leonardo's second Milan period.[1] Among the Lombard painters who have been suggested as possible authors are Cesare da Sesto,[a] Marco d'Oggiono, Francesco Melzi,[2] and Cesare Bernazzano. The painting shows a male figure with garlanded head and leopard skin, seated in an idyllic landscape. He points with his right hand off to his left, and with his left hand grasps his thyrsus and also points down to earth.

The painting originally depicted John the Baptist. In the late 17th century, between the years 1683 and 1693, it was overpainted and altered to serve as Bacchus.[b]

The model for the John the Baptist / Bacchus / Angelo incarnato series was Salaì.[3]

Cassiano dal Pozzo remarked of the painting in its former state, which he saw at Fontainebleau in 1625, that it had neither devotion, decorum nor similitude,[4] the suavely beautiful, youthful and slightly androgynous Giovannino was so at variance with artistic conventions in portraying the Baptist – neither the older ascetic prophet nor the Florentine baby Giovannino, but a type of Leonardo's invention, of a disconcerting, somewhat ambiguous sensuality, familiar in Leonardo's half-length and upward-pointing Saint John the Baptist, also in the Louvre.[5]

The overpainting transformed the image of St. John into one of a pagan deity, by converting the long-handled cross-like staff of the Baptist to a Bacchic thyrsus and adding a vine wreath. The fur robe is the legacy of John the Baptist, but has been overpainted with leopard-spots relating, like the wreath, to Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and intoxication.

Few copies done by Leonardeschi artists are known. One of them is attributed to Bernardino Lanino (panel, 24 x 24 cm) and is held at the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. It depicts St John the Baptist in Wilderness, however, the saint is placed to a background of grotto with some sight of high rocks, a river, riders and a hanged man. Another copy of 15th-16th centuries is held at Musee Ingres, Montauban. Another copy, attributed to follower of Cesare da Sesto was sold in auction at Christie's on 23 April 2008.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q542066,"Gabrielle d'Estrées et une de ses soeurs (Gabrielle d'Estrées and one of her sisters) is a painting by an unknown artist dated c. 1594. It is in the Louvre in Paris and is usually thought to be the work of a painter from the Fontainebleau School.[1][2]

The painting portrays Gabrielle d'Estrées, mistress of King Henry IV of France, sitting nude in a bath, holding a ring. Her sister Julienne-Hyppolite-Joséphine sits nude beside her and pinches d'Estrées' right nipple.[3]

In the early years of the seventeenth century, Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme told a story about a group of people who went to view the painting. He described the painting as showing ""fair naked ladies"" together in a bath, and adds that they ""touch, and feel, and handle, and stroke, one the other, and intertwine and fondle with each other."" Brantôme reveals that while the group was viewing the painting, ""one great lady"" who was a part of the group ""los[t] all restraint ... before the picture, say[ing] to her lover, turning toward him [as if] maddened [by] the madness of love she beheld [in the painting]: 'Too long have we tarried here. Let us now straightway take [my] coach and go to my lodging; for ... no more can I hold in the ardor that is in me. Needs must away and quench it; too sore do I burn.'""[4]

During the first half of the nineteenth century, Gabrielle d'Estrées et une de ses soeurs hung in the Prefecture of Police in Paris. Dr. Ver Heyden de Lacey stated in an article from 1935 that ""Nobody knew why or how it came there; [it was] placed above a door in one of the halls to which the public had access.""[5] He explained that one day, a ""pusillanimous high official"" noticed the painting and ""conceived [of] the idea to screen the picture...from the curious public gaze, by drawing a green curtain in front of it."" His action suggested that the official considered the painting to be erotic or even obscene, but instead of removing it, he had it veiled, and thus visibly marked the image as an open secret, or as something which should not be seen. At some point after that, Dr. Ver Heyden de Lacey claimed that ""Somebody had the happy inspiration to expose [the veiled image] to the artistic and art-trained eyes of those called upon to take part in [a] civic function [at the police station] ... In preparation [for this] special function ... a thorough cleaning of the picture itself was ordered .... [But] Upon drawing the curtain, [they found only] an empty picture frame.""

The nipple-pinching gesture has been interpreted as a symbolic announcement that Gabrielle is pregnant with Henry's child, César de Bourbon. According to the Louvre's website: ""The oddly affectionate way in which the sister is pinching Gabrielle d'Estrées' right breast has often been taken as symbolizing the latter's pregnancy with the illegitimate child of Henry IV. This interpretation would seem to be confirmed by the scene of the young woman sewing – perhaps preparing a layette for the coming child – in the background.""[6] The ring that Gabrielle holds is said to be Henry's coronation ring, which he may have given to her as a token of his love shortly before she died.

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the Gabrielle d'Estrées painting is often understood to represent female homosexuality, despite the fact that the women depicted are in fact sisters. It is listed in Lesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia by Bonnie Zimmerman,[7] and also appears on websites about lesbian history such as Sappho.com.[8] Even outside of the LGBT community, the painting is frequently understood as a representation of lesbianism. In 1991, it appeared on the cover of the French magazine L’Événement du jeudi to illustrate a story on lesbian chic.[9] In 2002, the German Green Party created a poster to announce their support of same-sex marriage, featuring two female models reenacting the Gabrielle portrait.[10]

It was rediscovered in 1945 in the parish church of Bois-Anzeray and acquired by the Société des amis du Louvre for the Louvre in 1979 as inventory number R.F. 1979–53.[1]

A second version is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin – it was long held to be the original work until being compared with the Louvre work in 1972 at an exhibition of the artist's work at the Orangerie des Tuileries. The Berlin work is now considered to be a studio copy – Jacques Thuillier has attributed it to Georges' son Étienne de La Tour with retouching by Georges.[2][3]

It is thought the painter sent the first version to Charles IV of Lorraine (1604–1675) in 1633, before painting a second version for Louis XIII of France, who liked it so much that he hung it alone in a room. A third version was also painted for the governor of Nancy in 1649. There are copies in Ruan, the chapel in Bois-Anzeray and the church in Broglie.

Hofstede de Groot in 1908 wrote; ""It is an excellent work, but it is in an exceedingly damaged condition. The trees are not, on the whole, well rendered; it is obvious that Metsu was no landscape painter...""

Sm. says (1833):—""This capital picture has had the reputation of being the chef d'œuvre of the master, and the large prices for which it has been sold go far to confirm that opinion. The writer, however, can by no means subscribe to it, for there are several described in this work that possess much higher claims to the admiration of the connoisseur.""[1]

The work is 38 and 32.5 inches, on canvas. It was at one point in the collection of King Louis XVI and is now in the Louvre.[1]

This painting was recently cleaned which makes it possible to observe more  details than before:

The marketwoman is seated on a wheelbarrow, and turns her head towards the viewer.

The dog might kill the rooster, which is tied with a string to its cage.

The chicken seems free but is sitting in mournful contemplation of the vegetables it will be cooked with.

A customer buys a hare from a woman in a market stall

A seated woman watches a man in a turban attentively. He is possibly a quack or a tea seller.

Across the canal a man and woman seem to be observing the market.

This woman is the owner of the wheelbarrow. She is wearing the straps she used to support the handles while walking with it.

While a young woman waits for the poultry seller, a young man in theater costume speaks to her.

The poultry seller is carrying another load of chickens and looking at his customer.

The work is a history painting depicting an episode from Plutarch's Lives in which Greek court physician Erasistratus diagnoses the illness of Antiochus, the son of Seleucus I, as lovesickness for his stepmother Stratonice.  The painting was awarded the 1774 Prix de Rome by the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture.

Painting painted in 1774. After its presentation in the competition for the Prix de Rome, it was recovered by David and entrusted to Michel-Jean Sedaine. In the Sedaine family, the painting then passed into the collection of the Comte de Brissay, son-in-law of Sedaine. In 1860 the House of the Emperor acquired it for 3000 francs, and it was installed at the National School of Fine Arts. The painting was restored in 1860 and 1981.[1]

Antiochus is bedridden, suffering from a sickly languor. His father, King Seleucus, is at the foot of the bed in the dark. To save his son, he called on the great physician Erasistratus.

The latter is beside him, taking his pulse: his left hand on Antiochus' wrist. The doctor asked that the women of the palace present themselves, one by one, before Antiochus. When Stratonice's turn comes, the young prince's pulse quickens, Erasistratus then raises his right hand, index finger pointing to the ""cause of the disease"".

Erasistratus convinced the king to give up the beautiful Stratonice to his son, and the prince recovers.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q945164,"Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt with his Page (c. 1607-1608) is a painting by the Italian master Caravaggio, in the Louvre of Paris.

Alof de Wignacourt joined the Order of the Knights of Saint John (the Knights of Malta) in 1564, aged seventeen, and distinguished himself the next year at the Great Siege of Malta, when the Turks were defeated and never returned to the island. He was elected Grand Master in 1601, determined to enhance the prestige of the Order and its new post-siege capital, Valletta. It was not surprising, therefore, that he would welcome the opportunity to have at his court the most famous painter in Rome and Naples, Michelangelo da Caravaggio.

Caravaggio arrived in Malta from Naples in July 1607 and according to his early biographers Giovanni Baglione and Giovanni Bellori, he began at once with portraits of Wignacourt and other knights from the highest ranks of the Order. This famous portrait shows the Grand Master in formal armour, holding his baton of command, every gleaming inch an image of the military might of the Knights. At the time Wignacourt was about sixty years old. He had strengthened the fortifications of the island, built an aqueduct to guarantee water to the city, and launched several attacks on the Turks. He had turned the Knights into a sovereign power, making himself in effect a prince answerable to no-one except the Pope, with his own increasingly wealthy court.

One of his innovations had been to surround to himself with young pages, in imitation of the fashion of the princely courts. The pages were taken from the most noble Catholic families of Europe. According to John Gash and others the page in the portrait is probably Nicholas de Paris Boissy, a French aristocrat destined for a distinguished career – he became Grand Prior of France in 1657. He is placed a little awkwardly within the composition: his feet are aligned with the feet of de Wignacourt, as if standing beside de Wignacourt, but his hand and the helmet overlap Wignacourt's elbow, giving the impression that from the waist up he is in front of the knight. The fact can be explained by Caravaggio's practice of painting separately from live models – de Wignacourt and the page were apparently not together in the studio at the same time.

The boy's lively expression and alert gaze make him an attractive subject in his own right, to the extent that he was several times copied by later artists visiting Malta.  Wignacourt, encased in splendid black and gold Milanese armour, stares upwards and outwards out of the frame in a dignified manner that invites the viewer to gaze upon him in awe, leaving the page, with his look of boyish interest, as the sole thoroughly human presence, and a far more sympathetic one than the self-conscious man of steel. The double-portrait with the pageboy was an unusual combination for the time. It may have been ordered by Wignacourt to stress the dignity of his court, or Caravaggio may have been inspired by a painting by Titian that he could have seen in his youth in Milan, Alfonso d'Avalos Addressing his Troops, showing the Spanish governor of the city addressing his knights with a page beside him holding his helmet.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3222518,"The Oyster Dinner (French - Le Déjeuner d'huîtres) is a 1735 painting by Jean-François de Troy. It and Nicolas Lancret's The Ham Dinner were commissioned by Louis XV to decorate the dining room in the lesser apartments at the Palace of Versailles. It includes the first appearance of a champagne bottle in painting. Both paintings are now in the Musée Condé.

This painting was commissioned by King Louis XV from the painter Jean-François de Troy, for the dining room of the small apartments of the Palace of Versailles, who produced it in 1735. At the same time, he produced two other paintings for the king's apartments : Le Déjeuner de Chasse (Musée du Louvre),[1] as well as a Deer at bay. For the first painting, the painter was only paid on January 20, 1738 by the sum of 2,400 pounds. In apartments, it was the counterpart to Nicolas Lancret's Déjeuner de Jamon. It was in place in 1737 and appears in the inventory of the royal collections at that date. But from 1768, the paintings left the apartments following their reorganization in office rooms and kitchens. In 1784, the paintings are present at the superintendence of the castle.[2]

During the Revolution, the painting was seized and sent to the Central Museum of Arts, ancestor of the Louvre Museum. During the Restoration, in 1817, Louis-Philippe I, then Duke of Orléans, claimed the work as well as its pendant because, according to him, they came, wrongly, from the collection of the Regent, his ancestor. He sends the two paintings, as well as Le Déjeuner de Chasse, recovered in the same way from his Château d'Eu. His son, the Duke of Aumale acquired it in 1857 during the sale of his father's collections in London. He obtains that the two pendants are withdrawn from sale: the Déjeuner d'huître is acquired for 3,000 francs. He installs them in his property of Orleans House in Twickenham. These paintings have a sentimental value for him: his father described to him the names of the characters represented here, even if art historians doubt today that they can represent characters who really existed. Returning to France in 1871, he exhibited it in the large gallery of his Château de Chantilly, currently owned by the Institut de France.[3]

The painting has undergone transformations: originally integrated into the woodwork, it was given a more regular form.[4] It finally underwent a complete cleaning in 2000, with the repair of uplifts and yellowing, as well as the removal of repaints in several places.[5]

The painting depicts an aristocratic meal scene in a richly decorated room. It represents an oyster lunch accompanied by champagne. Four figures look up at a popping champagne cork against the backdrop of the marble column. The painting is a documentary element for the knowledge of tableware in the 18th century: coolers, porcelain, salt shakers. The table in the center of the room is round, to avoid Etiquette usage. The chairs are caned, the dishes are silver. The bottles of champagne, more stocky than nowadays, are placed on the table. The glasses are placed in small porcelain coolers from China or Japan. In front of the table, a sideboard is used to keep bottles cool in ice and to store plates. This is undoubtedly one of the oldest representations of sparkling wine, invented at the end of the 17th century.[6]

The guests savored only one dish: oysters, very fashionable at that time, served with butter, salt or garlic. They are young lackeys with a towel at the waist who open the oysters for the guests. According to medical works of the time, oysters were then renowned for their aphrodisiac virtues: this belief could explain why the painting depicts only men and not a single woman, unlike its counterpart, Le Déjeuner de Jamon. This masculine exclusivity can also be explained by the fact that it was intended for the decoration of a dining room ""back from the hunt"", essentially occupied by men. This is the first dining room in the Palace of Versailles specially fitted out for this purpose, as previously the table was set in any room.[3]

The decor of the room, sumptuous, takes up in its upper part a work by Jean-François de Troy himself:[4] it is Zephyr and Flora (private collection, around 1725-1726). It is reproduced inverted, above a door, the painter thus doing his own advertising.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6481761,"Lamentation (Pietà) (also Lamentation Over The Dead Christ) is an oil painting on panel of the common subject of the Lamentation of Christ that is now regarded as by an artist in the ""circle"" of the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus, rather than by Christus himself.  It was painted in c. 1444, and is now in the Louvre in Paris.[1]

Bought by the Louvre in 1951 from the Schloss Fuschl Collection for 5,000,000 francs,[2] this work of the Flemish artist belongs to a groups of paintings in which the Italian influence is clearly visible: see for instance, the Entombment, the Nativity, the Death of the Virgin, and the Portrait of a Man.

Petrus Christus, working at Bruges, continued to paint in the style of Jan van Eyck at a time when most Flemish artists had abandoned this manner in favour of Rogier van der Weyden's more dramatic and Gothic character. He seems to have visited Italy some time between 1454 and 1462, and various factors suggest that he may have travelled as far as the south of Italy: Antonello da Messina's influence on him, for example, together with the presence of paintings from his hand in Sicily as early as the 16th century, and certain affinities between his work and that of the School of Naples.[3] He may possibly have contributed to the introduction of the Flemish technique of painting into Italy.

The artist's early manner was dry and awkward, with a tendency towards archaism, but under the beneficial influence of Antonello his work gained in suppleness, revealing a new sense of harmony and rhythm in the compositions, a monumental conception of the figures, and a certain proud dignity of facial expression. The Louvre painting has all these characteristics: the landscape is painted in broad planes, and the diagonal arrangement of the heads and the delicate arabesque on Christ's body contribute to the subtlety of the composition. The Virgin's head is a perfect oval, in the manner of Antonello da Messina; St. John's square-cut face, with his determined jaw, recalls that artist's portraits, and the woman's head seen in profile (very rare in the work of Flemish artists) is also reminiscent of certain heads by Italian painters.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3505997,"Madame Manet at the Piano  is a portrait by Édouard Manet of his wife Suzanne (née Leenhoff), produced in 1867-68 and now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[1] It highlights her talent on the piano - she played Wagner to Baudelaire during his last days.[2]

Before the advent of the radio and the gramophone, music lovers had to play their own pieces using sheet music. The piano in particular was a particularly popular instrument for this. It is estimated that around 1860 there were about 20,000 piano teachers active in Paris. In 1849 Manet's father appointed Suzanne Leenhoff as piano teacher for his sons. She was a gifted interpreter of composers such as Schumann and Wagner. When the poet Charles Baudelaire suffers a stroke in 1866 and ends up in a Paris hospital, she offers him a distraction by playing Wagner. A love affair develops between Leenhoff and Manet, which will eventually be sealed with a marriage in 1863.[3]

In 1868 Edgar Degas had made a painting of the Manet couple with Suzanne at the piano and her husband listening on the couch. Degas gave the canvas to Manet as a present. However, the latter was so dissatisfied with the way his wife had been portrayed that he cut off part of the canvas. Then he painted his own version. Suzanne Manet wears a stylish black dress on this. Manet chose a relatively high vantage point for this painting so that her hands are clearly visible. In the top right corner a small still life is visible in the mirror, including a clock and a pair of candlesticks. This lends depth and vibrancy to the flat background.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2354251,"The Barque of Dante (French: La Barque de Dante), also Dante and Virgil in Hell (Dante et Virgile aux enfers), is the first major painting by the French artist Eugène Delacroix, and is a work signalling the shift in the character of narrative painting, from Neo-Classicism towards Romanticism.[1] The painting loosely depicts events narrated in canto eight of Dante's Inferno; a leaden, smoky mist and the blazing City of the Dead form the backdrop against which the poet Dante fearfully endures his crossing of the River Styx. As his barque ploughs through waters heaving with tormented souls, Dante is steadied by Virgil, the learned poet of Classical antiquity.

Pictorially, the arrangement of a group of central, upright figures, and the rational arrangement of subsidiary figures in studied poses, all in horizontal planes, complies with the tenets of the cool and reflective Neo-Classicism that had dominated French painting for nearly four decades. The Barque of Dante was completed for the opening of the Salon of 1822, and currently hangs in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.[2]

The Barque of Dante was an artistically ambitious work, and although the composition is conventional, the painting in some important respects broke unmistakably free of the French Neo-Classical tradition.

The smoke to the rear and the fierce movement of the garment in which the oarsman Phlegyas is wrapped indicate a strong wind, and most of the individuals in the painting are facing into it. The river is choppy and the boat is lifted to the right, a point at which it is twisted toward the viewer. The party is driven to a destination known to be yet more inhospitable, by an oarsman whose sure-footed poise in the storm suggests his familiarity with these wild conditions. The city behind is a gigantic furnace. There is neither comfort nor a place of refuge in the painting's world of rage, insanity and despair.

The painting explores the psychological states of the individuals it depicts, and uses compact, dramatic contrasts to highlight their different responses to their respective predicaments. Virgil's detachment from the tumult surrounding him, and his concern for Dante's well-being, is an obvious counterpoint to the latter's fear, anxiety, and physical state of imbalance. The damned are either rapt in a piercing concentration upon some mad and gainless task, or are else apparently in a state of total helplessness and loss. Their lining of the boat takes an up-and-down wave-like form, echoing the choppy water and making the foot of the painting a region of perilous instability. The souls to the far left and right are like grotesque bookends, enclosing the action and adding a claustrophobic touch to the whole.

Delacroix wrote that his best painting of a head in this picture is that of the soul reaching with his forearm from the far side into the boat.[3] Both Charles Le Brun's, La Colère of 1668, and John Flaxman's line engraving The Fiery Sepulchres, appearing as plate 11 in The Divine Poem of Dante Alighieri, 1807, are likely sources for this head.[4]

The theatrical display of bold colours in the figures at the centre of the composition is striking. The red of Dante's cowl resonates alarmingly with the fired mass behind him, and vividly contrasts with the billowing blue about Phlegyas. The author Charles Blanc noted the white linen on Virgil's mantle, describing it as a 'great wake up in the middle of the dark, a flash in the tempest'.[5] Adolphe Loève-Veimars commented on the contrast between the colours used in Dante's head, and in the depiction of the damned, concluding that all this 'leaves the soul with I know not what fell impression'.[6] [4]

The drops of water running down the bodies of the damned are painted in a manner seldom seen up to and including the early nineteenth century. Four different, unmixed pigments, in discretely applied quantities comprise the image of one drop and its shadow. White is used for highlighting, strokes of yellow and green respectively denote the length of the drop, and the shadow is red.

Delacroix's pupil and chief assistant of over a decade, Pierre Andrieu, recorded that Delacroix had told him the inspiration for these drops had come in part from the water drops visible on the nereids in Rubens' The Landing of Marie de' Medici at Marseilles, and that the drops on The Barque of Dante were Delacroix's point of departure as a colourist.[7] Lee Johnson discussing these drops comments that ""the analytical principle [Delacroix] applies of dividing into pure coloured components an object that to the average eye would appear monochrome or colourless, is of far-reaching significance for the future.""[8]

In a letter to his sister, Madame Henriette de Verninac, written in 1821, Delacroix speaks of his desire to paint for the Salon the following year, and to 'gain a little recognition'.[9] In April 1822 he wrote to his friend Charles Soulier that he had been working hard and non-stop for two and a half months to precisely that end. The Salon opened on April 24, 1822 and Delacroix's painting was exhibited under the title Dante et Virgile conduits par Phlégias, traversent le lac qui entoure les murailles de la ville infernale de Dité.[10] The intense labour that was required to complete this painting in time left Delacroix weak and in need of recuperation.[11]

Critics expressed a range of opinions about The Barque of Dante. One of the judges at the Salon, Étienne-Jean Delécluze, was uncomplimentary, calling the work 'a real daub' (une vraie tartouillade). Another judge, Antoine-Jean Gros, thought highly of it, describing it a 'chastened Rubens'.[4] An anonymous reviewer in Le Miroir expected Delacroix to become a 'distinguished colourist'.[12] One particularly favourable piece of criticism from up-and-coming lawyer Adolphe Thiers received wide circulation in the liberal periodical Le Constitutionnel.[13] [14]

In the summer of 1822, the French State purchased the painting for 2000 Francs, and moved it to the Musée du Luxembourg. Delacroix was delighted on hearing the news, although he feared the piece would be less admired for being viewed at close quarters. Some two year later he revisited the painting, reporting that it gave him much pleasure, but describing it as being insufficiently vigorous; a deficiency he had identified in the painting he was working on at the time, The Massacre at Chios.[15][16][17] The painting was moved in 1874—eleven years after the death of the artist—to its present location, the Musée du Louvre.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1133114,"Venus and Cupid with a Satyr (c. 1528) is a painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Antonio da Correggio. It is now in the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

This painting  was in the 16th century in the private collection of count Nicholas Maffei. It is very likely that one of the members of the Maffei family has commissioned two paintings that they then arrived in the 17th century in the collection of the Gonzaga family, with whom the Maffei were relatives. In fact, the son of count Nicholas Maffei, count Frederick Maffei, married Isabel, daughter of Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga.

The work depicts Venus sleeping with her son Eros. Behind them, a satyr is caught while discovering the goddess. The picture is often also seen as portraying Jupiter and Antiope as, according to mythology and Ovid, Jupiter had turned himself into a satyr to rape the nymph.

The painting was probably connected to Correggio's Venus with Mercury and Cupid (The School of Love), now in the National Gallery of London. It, or a copy of it, can be seen in the 1628 painting of the gallery of Cornelis van der Geest, by Willem van Haecht.

The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest, by Haecht, shows this painting on the right wall.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3228069,"The Bolt (French: Le Verrou), also known as The Lock, is a gallant scene painted by Jean-Honoré Fragonard in 1777. It is one of the most famous paintings by the painter. The common interpretation suggests that the scene depicts two lovers entwined in a bedroom, the man locking the door. The painting is preserved in the Louvre Museum, in the section of the Department of Paintings devoted to eighteenth-century French painting on the second floor of the Sully wing. It stands together with some of the most famous pictorial masterpieces of the same period, in a chronologically organized path. This painting, a true symbol of the libertine spirit of the 18th century, reflects the state of mind adopted by the painters of the era, notably that of François Boucher, one of Fragonard's teachers and a great representative of rococo painting.

The work was commissioned in 1773 by Louis-Gabriel Véri-Raionard, Marquis de Véri (1722–1785). Having been produced for such a reputable and demanding collector, this erotic painting, ostensibly light but asserting a real ambition, formed part of a collection of depictions that were amorous, at times coarse and yet eminently representative of the spirit of French society at a time when the Enlightenment movement was about to waver. The canvas seemed to unveil a profound revitalization of Fragonard's inspiration that first distinguished itself in historical paintings, in particular Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols, first prize of Rome 1752. The obtaining of this distinction allowed Fragonard to enjoy a great fame. His scenes of gallantry were extremely popular, and the nobility offered him many commissions, like that of Baron Saint-Julian for The Swing (1767).

Originally, Fragonard had given The Bolt a more suitable twin: The Contract, itself following on from another called The Armoire. The painting, which belonged to the Marquis of Véri's collection, was brought to us thanks to the etching of Maurice Blot, who had, 8 years previously, made an etching of The Bolt. This print, considered as mediocre, had great success, however, attributable in large part to the fame of Fragonard. Indeed, a theory claimed that the two works, The Contract and The Bolt, constitute, along with another painting of Fragonard, The Armoire, the three chapters of a novel in which the heroes would be the two lovers. The Bolt illustrated the passion of the couple, The Armoire, the discovery of their affair and being caught in the act, and The Contract, their reconciliation.

The Bolt is often considered alongside a work of more sacred inspiration, The Adoration of the Shepherds (1775). This canvas, also commissioned by the marquis, was suggested by Fragonard himself. It shows Fragonard's will to revive holy artwork and draw contrast between two types of love: carnal or libertine love, belonging to the 18th century, and sacred, religious love.

Fragonard started by making several sketches and surveys of The Bolt. He may have used models for the realization of his work. He drew inspiration from writings of his time. Gault de Saint-Germain said of him that ""Ariosto, Boccaccio, La Fontaine were his inspirers and his ingenious teachers, spiritual in the inventiveness, he got sometimes the freshness of the color of his inimitable models.""

Like François Boucher, Fragonard prepared his canvases with a toned ground of red or gray. On this he first sketched the subject by an outline, then applied the paint in several superimposed layers. His stroke was fine, light but precise, nervous and effective.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3292681,"Portrait of Madame de Senonnes (once known as La Trastéverine) is an 1816 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It shows  Madame de Senonnes, née Marie-Genevieve-Marguerite Marcoz, viscountess of Senonnes (1783–1828). Marcoz was 31 when the portrait was completed. Ingres had earlier portrayed her in a drawing of 1813.

The portrait is considered one of Ingres' finest. Because she was significantly attractive and aristocratic, Ingres, who professed to disdain portraiture but who needed the income it provided, put great effort into the work in the hope of attracting other commissions.[1] Portrait of Madame de Senonnes is part of the collection of Le tableau fait partie des collections at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes.

Born into a relatively wealthy family, she married Jean Marcoz, a merchant draper, in 1802, and they moved to Rome in 1803, and had a daughter, Geneviève-Amélina Talensier that year. However, the marriage was unhappy, and they separated in 1809. Talensier left Rome to fight in the French army, and was wounded twice.[2]

She began to socialise in artistic circles, passing herself off as Italian. Marcoz met Alexandre de La Motte-Baracé, Viscount of Senonne, and they married in 1815, the year after their return to France.[2]

After her death in 1828, the portrait remained in the possession of her husband until 1831, when, pursued by creditors, he sent it to his elder brother, the Marquis de Senonnes, where it was kept in his castle in Feneu, in the west of France. The painting remained there until 1852, when it was sold to an art dealer.[3] It was acquired in 1853 by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes for 4,000 francs.

Marcoz is shown in a seductive[4] and languid pose on a sofa, her hair tightly pulled back. She is dressed in a low cut luxurious velvet gown trimmed with ochre, Indian muslin, a blond lace collar, and transparent lace, and with a white cashmere shawl. She is painted in bright red and gold colors, against a large, dark circular, mirror, lit by candle light, that reflects the back of her head and, especially, the curve of her neck. Her hands, which contain thirteen pale red and green jewel studded rings, caresses a white pillow and handkerchief.[4] As with all of Ingres' female portraits, the sitter seems limbless, as if her body was not supported by a bone structure.[4]

The work is Ingres' first to fully explore the use of a mirror, and the additional spatial space it allows,[4] earlier seen but not as successfully, in the 1805 Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.[5]

His signature is written in the business tucked into the edge of the mirror.[2] A number of small paper studies survive; the earliest of which show her reclining erotically on a sofa, the later sketches focus on the presentation of her upper body and chest.[5] Some art historians have compared it in tone to his Grande Odalisque, which he was working on simultaneously.[3]

Among the sources that Ingres took inspiration from were Jacques-Louis David's Portrait of madame de Verninac (1799),[6] and Leonardo da Vinci's 
La belle ferronnière.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2289754,"The Lady and the Unicorn (French: La Dame à la licorne) is the modern title given to a series of six tapestries created in the style of mille-fleurs (""thousand flowers"") and woven in Flanders from wool and silk, from designs (""cartoons"") drawn in Paris around 1500.[1] The set is on display in the Musée de Cluny in Paris.

Five of the tapestries are commonly interpreted as depicting the five senses – taste, hearing, sight, smell, and touch. The sixth displays the words ""À mon seul désir"". The tapestry's intended meaning is obscure, but has been interpreted as representing love or understanding. Each of the six tapestries depicts a noble lady with the unicorn on her left and a lion on her right; some include a monkey in the scene.

The tapestries were rediscovered in 1841 by Prosper Mérimée in Boussac castle (owned at the time by the subprefect of the Creuse) where they had been suffering damage from their storage conditions. In 1844, the novelist George Sand saw them and brought public attention to the tapestries in her works at the time (most notably in her novel Jeanne), in which she correctly dated them to the end of the 15th century, using the ladies' costumes for reference.[2]: 180  Nevertheless, the tapestries continued to be threatened by damp and mould until 1863, when they were bought by Edmond Du Sommerard, curator of the Musée de Cluny in Paris, where careful conservation has restored them nearly to their former glory and where they are still on display.

The subject of the tapestries is complex, and scholars ""now (generally) agree that they present a meditation on earthly pleasures and courtly culture, offered through an allegory of the senses.""[3]

The pennants, as well as the armor of the unicorn and lion in the tapestry appear to bear the arms of Antoine II or Jean IV Le Viste, Baron of Montreuil, a powerful nobleman in the court of Charles VII of France and presumably its sponsor. The arms, however, appear to break the rules of French heraldry with an incorrect superposition of colors. A very recent study of the heraldry appears to lend credence to another hypothesis (previously dismissed) that the real sponsor of the tapestry was Antoine II Le Viste (1470–1534), a descendant of the younger branch of the Le Viste family and an important figure at the court of Charles VIII, Louis XII and François I.[a]

The 'Touch' tapestry displays a noble lady standing with one hand touching the horn of a unicorn, and the other holding up a pennant. A lion sits to the side and looks on.

In the 'Taste' tapestry, the lady takes sweets from a dish held by a maidservant. Her eyes are on a parakeet on her upheld left hand. The lion and the unicorn are both standing on their hind legs, reaching up to pennants that frame the lady on either side. The monkey is at her feet, eating one of the sweetmeats.

In the 'Smell' tapestry, the lady stands, making a wreath of flowers. Her maidservant holds a basket of flowers within her easy reach. Again, the lion and unicorn frame the lady while holding on to the pennants. The monkey has stolen a flower which he is smelling, providing the key to the allegory.

In the 'Hearing' tapestry, the lady plays a portative organ on top of a table covered with an Oriental rug. Her maidservant stands to the opposite side and operates the bellows. The lion and unicorn once again frame the scene holding up the pennants. Just as on all the other tapestries, the unicorn is to the lady's left and the lion to her right.

In the 'Sight' tapestry, the lady is seated, holding a mirror up in her right hand. The unicorn kneels on the ground, with his front legs in the lady's lap, from which he gazes at his reflection in the mirror. The lion on the left holds up a pennant.

The sixth tapestry is wider than the others, and has a somewhat different style. The lady stands in front of a tent, across the top of which is inscribed her motto, ""À Mon Seul Désir"", one of the deliberately obscure and elegant mottos, typically alluding to courtly love, adopted by the nobility during the age of chivalry. It is variously interpreted as ""to my only/sole desire"", ""according to my desire alone""; ""by my will alone"", ""love desires only beauty of soul"", and ""to calm passion"".[b] These frequently appear on artworks and illuminated miniatures. Her maidservant stands to the right, holding open a chest. The lady is placing the necklace she wears in the other tapestries, into the chest. To her left is a low bench with a dog, possibly a Maltese, sitting on a decorative pillow. It is the only tapestry in which she is seen to smile. The unicorn and the lion stand in their normal spots framing the lady while holding onto the pennants.

This tapestry has elicited a number of interpretations.[5] One interpretation sees the lady putting the necklace into the chest as a renunciation of the passions aroused by the other senses, and as an assertion of her free will. Another sees the tapestry as representing a sixth sense of understanding (derived from the sermons of Jean Gerson of the University of Paris, c. 1420). Various other interpretations see the tapestry as representing love or virginity. It is also debated whether the lady in ""À Mon Seul Désir"" is picking up or setting aside the necklace.

In the first five tapestries, one or more of the animals are shown using the represented sense along with the lady. In Touch, the unicorn can presumably feel the lady's hand touching its horn; in Taste, a monkey is eating a sweetmeat; in Smell, the monkey is sniffing a flower; in Hearing, the animals presumably all hear the music; and in Sight, the unicorn is gazing at itself in a mirror. In the final tapestry, only the women engage with the necklace. The blue tent in the last tapestry also serves to separate the human figures from the natural world, including the mythical unicorn, and is not present in any of the previous tapestries.

Hearing, 3.70 m × 2.90 m (12.1 ft × 9.5 ft)

Sight, 3.10 m × 3.30 m (10.2 ft × 10.8 ft)

""À Mon Seul Désir"", 3.80 m × 4.64 m (12.5 ft × 15.2 ft)

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6287319,"A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts, also known as Lorenzo Tornabuoni Presented by Grammar to Prudentia and the other Liberal Arts or Lorenzo Tornabuoni Being Introduced to the Liberal Arts (Italian: Giovane Introdotto tra le Arti Liberali), is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli, circa 1483–1486. The painting and its companion piece, Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman, originally decorated Villa Lemmi, a country villa near Florence owned by Giovanni Tornabuoni, uncle of Lorenzo de' Medici and head of the Roman branch of the Medici Bank. They were probably commissioned for the 1486 wedding of Giovanni's son Lorenzo to Giovanna of the Albizzi family, and are therefore thought to depict the two.[1]

A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts depicts a young man, perhaps Lorenzo Tornabuoni, led by a personification of Grammar into a circle of allegorical figures representing the Seven Liberal Arts. Presided over by Prudentia, the circle also includes Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music, each recognizable by means of various attributes. In antiquity, the liberal arts denoted the education worthy of a free person and the painting therefore testifies to the young man's broad education. The figure of Arithmetic is seen holding its hand out in greeting to the young man. Tornabuoni, a scion to a banking family, would have probably had an education focused on numbers.[1]

Both paintings were discovered at Villa Lemmi in 1873 under a coat of whitewash and removed from their original location. They are now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3399514,"The Portrait of Pope Pius VII is an 1805 portrait of Pope Pius VII by the French painter Jacques-Louis David to thank the pope for assisting at the coronation of Napoleon I of France. Pope Pius appears in David's The Coronation of Napoleon, depicted as blessing the emperor, when in fact he was merely a spectator, assisting at the ceremony with a resigned expression throughout.

The painting seems to have been commissioned by Count Charles Fleurieu, Quartermaster General for the French emperor, though no written mention of a commission survives. It was painted at the Tuileries around the end of February 1805 from life. David seems to have been won over and impressed by Pius's simplicity and deep humanity, choosing to show him in an introspective pose rather than as the most powerful prelate in Christianity. He was paid 10,000 francs for his work and the portrait was exhibited in the Gallery of the French Senate at its seat in the Château du Luxembourg and then assigned to the Musée Napoléon (now known as the Louvre). It was displayed again at the Château in 1824 before being returned to its permanent home in the Louvre in 1827.

David produced three copies of the portrait, assisted by one of his students (probably Georges Rouget), two of which were commissioned by Napoleon for the Musée de Fontainebleau and for the Musée du Château de Versailles. David held onto the third copy and took it with him during his exile to Brussels, and which is now lost.

Vertical in format and with a brown background, the painting shows Pius three-quarter-length seated on a red velvet chair embroidered in gold. He has a peaceful expression and wears a white zucchetto, a white rochet or tunic (of which only the sleeves can be seen), a red velvet pelerine-type camail with ermine cuffs and a red stole with gold embroidery. Pius's arms rest on the chair's arms and his right hand holds a paper on which is written in Latin Pio VII Bonarium Artium Patron (Pius VII, Patron of the Fine Arts). The painting is signed top left with LUD. DAVID PARISIIS 1805.

David produced the painting to compete for the Prix de Rome of 1771. For the competition, he and the seven other participating artists were assigned the task of painting a new work in 10 weeks on a set subject, which that year was the Iliad. David's painting was awarded the second prize as the Prix de Rome was given to Joseph-Benoît Suvée.[1] David believed that harsh criticism of his work by his teacher Joseph-Marie Vien had caused the prize to be awarded to an inferior painter, and became disgruntled with the academy, which he considered to be a dishonest institution.[2] In 1774, David finally won the competition on his fourth attempt with Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3772184,"The Beggars or The Cripples is an oil-on-panel by the Netherlandish Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted in 1568. It is now in the Louvre in Paris.

This work is the only painting by Bruegel in the Louvre, received as a gift in 1892.

Attempts have been made to interpret the picture of five cripples and a beggar-woman as an allusion to a historical event: the badger's tails, or foxes' tails, on their clothes might refer to the Gueux, a rebel party formed against the government of Philip II of Spain and Granvelle; but these also occur in Bruegel's The Fight Between Carnival and Lent in Vienna, dated 1559. Still, the beggars are not quite ordinary beggars, as they wear carnival headgear representing various classes of society: a cardboard crown (the king), a paper shako (the soldier), a beret (the bourgeois), a cap (the peasant), and a mitre (the bishop). The work clearly has some satirical meaning, which has so far eluded interpretation. Perhaps physical imperfections are meant to symbolise moral decrepitude, which can affect all men irrespective of class.[1]

On the back of the painting are two inscriptions which seem to date from the 16th century. One is in Flemish, and in a very fragmentary state;[2] the other is in Latin and records the admiration some humanist felt for Bruegel, whose art surpasses Nature itself.[3]

The painting dates from the end of Bruegel's career, when he showed a keener interest in the natural world. Tiny though it is, the landscape seen through the opening is bathed in a delicate light which simmers like dew on the foliage.

On the back of the painting is written:[4]

What nature lacks, is lacking in our art,
So great was the grace accorded to our painter.
Here nature, expressed in painted forms, is astonished
To see through these cripples that Bruegel is her equal.

Modern eyes may be inclined to conclude that Brugel intended to invoke sympathy for the plight of the disabled figures, but from a historical perspective this is unlikely.  Europeans of Bruegel's time gave little regard to beggars, and the painting provides hints that Bruegel shared this denigration: the figures are outside the town walls and are posed in such ways as to provoke contempt and amusement.  The foxtail on some of the figures was a symbol at the time of ridicule in political caricature and real life.  The woman behind them bears an empty bowl and may appear to be ignoring the beggars.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3824633,"La Toilette, also known as Rousse, is an 1889 painting by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The painting depicts a red-headed woman, stripped to the waist, seated on the floor, facing away from the viewer, just before or just after bathing. Held by public collections in France since 1914, it has been at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1983.

The painting depicts a domestic scene of a woman, sitting on a plain towel or sheet over a dark rug on the bare floorboards. She is largely undressed, with bare back, arms and head, hair tied back, and bare right thigh visible. A swathe of plain fabric is wrapped around her waist, with a black boot or stocking on her right lower leg. Other clothing is draped over a chair to the left.

The work was painted in oils on cardboard, and measures 67 cm × 54 cm (26 in × 21 in). It employs a light colour palette, predominantly blues with yellowish greens and red for the woman's hair, thinned with turpentine to create a loose effect. The Impressionist image, similar to a work in pastels or a sketch, with an elevated viewpoint, shows some influence from similar works by Edgar Degas, including those exhibited at the 8th (and last) Impressionist exhibition in Paris in 1886.

In the background are two wickerwork chairs and a bathtub, suggesting the woman is undressing to bathe, or getting dressed after washing. The furniture, recognisable from contemporaneous photographs, suggests the work was painted at Toulouse-Lautrec's studio on the rue Caulaincourt [fr] in Paris. It may have been made in one session, directly from life, with no studies. The model may be one of Toulouse-Lautrec's favourites, Carmen Gaudin (1866?–1920).

It was catalogued as La toilette and dated 1896 for some time, but recent research suggests it was painted several years earlier, in 1889. It was one of two works that Toulouse-Lautrec exhibited with Les XX (""The twenty"", an avant-garde art group) in Brussels in 1890 under the title Rousse (red-head). In the catalogue, it was described as ""a red-haired woman seated on the floor, seen from the back, nude"".

The painting was donated to France by Pierre Goujon [fr] on his death in 1914. It was first displayed in the Musée du Luxembourg, then at the Musée National d'Art Moderne, and later at the Musée du Louvre. It was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1983.

Générosité d'Alexandre or Generosity of Alexander is a neoclassical style, oil-on-canvas painting by Jérôme-Martin Langlois.[1] The painting was exhibited at the 1819 Paris Salon and won a first-prize medal. It is currently on display at the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse, France. In the painting, Alexander the Great gives his concubine, Campaspe, as a gift to the painter Apelles when he sees that the painter has fallen in love with her. The painting is a depiction of a well-known and perhaps apocryphal story of Alexander the Great's generosity.

In the painting Apelles is sketching Alexander the Great's mistress Campaspe and has fallen in love with her. Alexander is so appreciative of the painter's skill that he gives him Campaspe. The painter is portrayed as thankful and Campaspe is seen sitting with her feet on a leopard skin, looking down toward the floor.[2]

The dimensions of the painting are 287 cm (113 in) x 356.9 cm (140.5 in).[3] The Neoclassical style painting follows the theme of an unfinished 1813 painting with the same subject matter by Langlois' teacher Jacques-Louis David.[4][5]

The painting won a first-prize medal[4] and was purchased at the 1819 Paris Salon.[6] It is in the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse, France, which is currently closed for renovations until 2025.[4][7]

Langlois also completed a black chalk presentation drawing,[4] sized 39 cm (15 in) x 51.4 cm (20.2 in), in preparation for the painting. It was titled Alexander Ceding Campaspe to Apelles and was exhibited at Zagrelli, Brady & Co. in 1986.[1]

The Raft of the Medusa (French: Le Radeau de la Méduse [lə ʁado d(ə) la medyz]) – originally titled Scène de Naufrage (Shipwreck Scene) – is an oil painting of 1818–19 by the French Romantic painter and lithographer Théodore Géricault (1791–1824).[1] Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491 by 716 cm (16 ft 1 in by 23 ft 6 in),[2] it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate Méduse, which ran aground off the coast of today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism (the custom of the sea). The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.

Géricault chose this large-scale uncommissioned work to launch his career, using a subject that had already generated widespread public interest.[3] The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.

Although The Raft of the Medusa retains elements of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.[4]

In June 1816, the French frigate Méduse, captained by Hugues Duroy de Chaumareys, departed from Rochefort, bound for the Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette Écho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys, a recently returned royalist émigré, had been appointed captain of the frigate by the newly restored Bourbon administration despite having scarcely sailed in 20 years.[6][7] After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though this was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside the concerns of the monarch.[8] The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-Désiré Schmaltz, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.[9]

In an effort to make good time, the Méduse overtook the other ships, but due to poor navigation it drifted 160 kilometres (100 mi) off course. On 2 July, it ran aground on a sandbank off the West African coast, near today's Mauritania. The collision was widely blamed on the incompetence of De Chaumereys, a returned émigré who lacked experience and ability, but had been granted his commission as a result of an act of political preferment.[10][11][12] Efforts to free the ship failed, so, on 5 July, the frightened passengers and crew started an attempt to travel the 100 km (60 mi) to the African coast in the frigate's six boats. Although the Méduse was carrying 400 people, including 160 crew, there was space for only about 250 in the boats. The remainder of the ship's complement and half of a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to garrison Senegal[13]—at least 146 men and one woman—were piled onto a hastily built raft, that partially submerged once it was loaded. Seventeen crew members opted to stay aboard the grounded Méduse. The captain and crew aboard the other boats intended to tow the raft, but after only a few miles the raft was turned loose.[14] For sustenance the crew of the raft had only a bag of ship's biscuit (consumed on the first day), two casks of water (lost overboard during fighting) and six casks of wine.[15]

According to critic Jonathan Miles, the raft carried the survivors ""to the frontiers of human experience. Crazed, parched and starved, they slaughtered mutineers, ate their dead companions and killed the weakest.""[10][16] After 13 days, on 17 July 1816, the raft was rescued by the Argus by chance—no particular search effort was made by the French for the raft.[17] By this time only 15 men were still alive; the others had been killed or thrown overboard by their comrades, died of starvation, or had thrown themselves into the sea in despair.[18] The incident became a huge public embarrassment for the French monarchy, only recently restored to power after Napoleon's defeat in 1815.[19][20]

The Raft of the Medusa portrays the moment when, after 13 days adrift on the raft, the remaining 15 survivors view a ship approaching from a distance. According to an early British reviewer, the work is set at a moment when ""the ruin of the raft may be said to be complete"".[21] The painting is on a monumental scale of 491 cm × 716 cm (193 in × 282 in), so that most of the figures rendered are life-sized[22] and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant.[23]

The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles,[24] stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.[25]

The pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.[citation needed]

The viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right.[22] According to the art historian Justin Wintle, ""a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex.""[26] Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the Argus, the ship that eventually rescued the survivors.[3]

Géricault's palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors' clothes, the sea and the clouds.[27] Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that Géricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain.[28] The work's lighting has been described as ""Caravaggesque"",[29] after the Italian artist closely associated with tenebrism—the use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even Géricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures.[30] From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.[30]

Géricault was captivated by accounts of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish his reputation as a painter.[31] Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with two survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and Alexandre Corréard, an engineer from the École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting.[21] According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, ""Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided.""[32]

Earlier travels had exposed Géricault to victims of insanity and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses.[11] To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead,[3] he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon,[31] studied the faces of dying hospital patients,[33] brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay,[31][34] and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.[33]

He worked with Corréard, Savigny and another of the survivors, the carpenter Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of the planks.[33] Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky.[33] Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast on a number of occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the English Channel.[28][35]

He drew and painted numerous preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative moments of the disaster he would depict in the final work.[36] The painting's conception proved slow and difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event.

Among the scenes he considered were the mutiny against the officers from the second day on the raft, the cannibalism that occurred after only a few days, and the rescue.[37] Géricault ultimately settled on the moment, recounted by one of the survivors, when they first saw, on the horizon, the approaching rescue ship Argus—visible in the upper right of the painting—which they attempted to signal. The ship, however, passed by. In the words of one of the surviving crew members, ""From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief.""[37]

To a public well-versed in the particulars of the disaster, the scene would have been understood to encompass the aftermath of the crew's abandonment, focusing on the moment when all hope seemed lost[37]—the Argus reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.[39]

The author Rupert Christiansen points out that the painting depicts more figures than had been on the raft at the time of the rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.[33]

Géricault, who had just been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic existence in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out.[33] He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.[33]

He used friends as models, most notably the painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who modelled for the figure in the foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow at the foot of the mast;[36] three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.[33]

Much later, Delacroix—who would become the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, ""Géricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa while he was still working on it. It made so tremendous an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room.""[40][41][42][43]

Géricault, who was an abolitionist,[44][45] hired a Haitian model named Joseph to paint at least two Black individuals on the raft.[46] Most notably, Joseph served as a model for what is considered to be a representation of Jean Charles, a military officer waving a dark red handkerchief in hopes of being noticed by the passing ship. Influenced by an ancient Greek Classical sculpture titled Belvedere Torso and with his back turned toward the viewer, Joseph's silhouette is placed atop the pyramidal grouping of survivors in the composition's right half.[47] In addition, a small rendering of Joseph's face, with his gaze directed toward the spectator, is placed within a group of three figures positioned between the wooden mast and the supporting rope on the mast's right-hand side.[46]

Géricault painted with small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed little time for reworking and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, Cassel earth and bitumen.[33] Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but over a period of time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated.[48] As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.[23]

Géricault drew an outline sketch of the composition onto the canvas. He then posed models one at a time, completing each figure before moving onto the next, as opposed to the more usual method of working over the whole composition. The concentration in this way on individual elements gave the work both a ""shocking physicality""[26] and a sense of deliberate theatricality—which some critics consider an adverse effect. Over 30 years after the completion of the work, his friend Montfort recalled:

[Géricault's method] astonished me as much as his intense industry. He painted directly on the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I was struck by the keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm ...[33][49]
Working with little distraction, the artist completed the painting in eight months;[28] the project as a whole took 18 months.[33]

The Raft of the Medusa fuses many influences from the Old Masters, from the Last Judgment and Sistine Chapel ceiling of Michelangelo (1475–1564) and Raphael's Transfiguration,[50] to the monumental approach of Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825) and Antoine-Jean Gros (1771–1835), to contemporary events.  By the 18th century, shipwrecks had become a recognised feature of marine art, as well as an increasingly common occurrence as more journeys were made by sea. Claude Joseph Vernet (1714–1789) created many such images,[51] achieving naturalistic colour through direct observation—unlike other artists at that time—and was said to have tied himself to the mast of a ship in order to witness a storm.[52]

Although the men depicted on the raft had spent 13 days adrift and suffered hunger, disease and cannibalism, Géricault pays tribute to the traditions of heroic painting and presents his figures as muscular and healthy. According to the art historian Richard Muther, there is still a strong debt to Classicism in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid ""unpictorial"" costumes. Muther observes that there is ""still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death"".[30]

The influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting's scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant ""fruitful moment""—the first awareness of the approaching ship—is described.[29] In 1793, David also painted an important current event with The Death of Marat. His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the revolution in France, and it served as an important precedent for Géricault's decision to also paint a current event. David's pupil, Antoine-Jean Gros, had, like David, represented ""the grandiosities of a school irredeemably associated with a lost cause"",[54] but in some major works, he had given equal prominence to Napoleon and anonymous dead or dying figures.[37][55] Géricault had been particularly impressed by the 1804 painting Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Victims of Jaffa, by Gros.[11]

The young Géricault had painted copies of work by Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758–1823), whose ""thunderously tragic pictures"" include his masterpiece, Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime, where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously influenced Géricault's painting.[48]

The foreground figure of the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, which was one of the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli.[56] An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.[57]

Several English and American paintings including The Death of Major Pierson by John Singleton Copley (1738–1815)—also painted within two years of the event—had established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which Géricault may have known from prints: Watson and the Shark (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like The Raft of the Medusa, concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782 (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of Géricault's work; and Scene of a Shipwreck (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition.[37][58] A further important precedent for the political component was the works of Francisco Goya, particularly his The Disasters of War series of 1810–12, and his 1814 masterpiece The Third of May 1808. Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply Shipwreck (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style have nothing in common with The Raft of the Medusa. It is unlikely that Géricault had seen the picture.[58]

The Raft of the Medusa was first shown at the 1819 Paris Salon, under the title Scène de Naufrage (Shipwreck Scene), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers.[33] The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs.[11] Géricault's canvas was the star at the exhibition: ""It strikes and attracts all eyes"" (Le Journal de Paris). Louis XVIII visited three days before the opening and reportedly said: ""Monsieur, vous venez de faire un naufrage qui n'en est pas un pour vous"",[59] freely translated as ""Monsieur Géricault, your shipwreck is certainly no disaster"".[60] The critics were divided: the horror and ""terribilità"" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a ""pile of corpses"", whose realism they considered a far cry from the ""ideal beauty"" represented by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea, which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: ""Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel."" The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal, who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its modernity. The historian Jules Michelet approved: ""our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa"".[3]

Géricault had deliberately sought to be both politically and artistically confrontational. Critics responded to his aggressive approach in kind, and their reactions were either ones of revulsion or praise, depending on whether the writer's sympathies favoured the Bourbon or Liberal viewpoint. The painting was seen as largely sympathetic to the men on the raft, and thus by extension to the anti-imperial cause adopted by the survivors Savigny and Corréard.[21] The decision to place a black man at the pinnacle of the composition was a controversial expression of Géricault's abolitionist sympathies. The art critic Christine Riding has speculated that the painting's later exhibition in London was planned to coincide with anti-slavery agitation there.[62] According to art critic and curator Karen Wilkin, Géricault's painting acts as a ""cynical indictment of the bungling malfeasance of France's post-Napoleonic officialdom, much of which was recruited from the surviving families of the Ancien Régime"".[27]

The painting generally impressed the viewing public, although its subject matter repelled many, thus denying Géricault the popular acclaim which he had hoped to achieve.[33] At the end of the exhibition, the painting was awarded a gold medal by the judging panel, but they did not give the work the greater prestige of selecting it for the Louvre's national collection. Instead, Géricault was awarded a commission on the subject of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, whose finished painting he then signed as his own.[33] Géricault retreated to the countryside, where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his unsold work was rolled up and stored in a friend's studio.[63]

Géricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820, where it was shown at William Bullock's Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, from 10 June until the end of the year, and viewed by about 40,000 visitors.[64] The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in French art. It received more positive reviews than when it was shown at the Salon.[65] In part, this was due to the manner of the painting's exhibition: in Paris it had initially been hung high in the Salon Carré—a mistake that Géricault recognised when he saw the work installed—but in London it was placed close to the ground, emphasising its monumental impact. There may have been other reasons for its popularity in England as well, including ""a degree of national self-congratulation"",[66] the appeal of the painting as lurid entertainment,[66] and two theatrical entertainments based around the events on the raft which coincided with the exhibition and borrowed heavily from Géricault's depiction.[67] From the London exhibition Géricault earned close to 20,000 francs, which was his share of the fees charged to visitors, and substantially more than he would have been paid had the French government purchased the work from him.[68] After the London exhibition, Bullock brought the painting to Dublin early in 1821, but the exhibition there was far less successful, in large part due to a competing exhibition of a moving panorama, ""The Wreck of the Medusa"" by the Marshall brothers firm, which was said to have been painted under the direction of one of the survivors of the disaster.[69]

The Raft of the Medusa was championed by the curator of the Louvre, comte de Forbin who purchased it for the museum from Géricault's heirs after his death in 1824. The painting now dominates its gallery there.[19] The display caption tells us that ""the only hero in this poignant story is humanity"".[3]

At some time between 1826 and 1830 American artist George Cooke (1793–1849) made a copy of the painting in a smaller size, (130.5 x 196.2 cm; approximately 4 ft × 6 ft), which was shown in Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C. to crowds who knew about the controversy surrounding the shipwreck. Reviews favoured the painting, which also stimulated plays, poems, performances and a children's book.[71]  It was bought by a former admiral, Uriah Phillips, who left it in 1862 to the New York Historical Society, where it was miscatalogued as by Gilbert Stuart and remained inaccessible until the mistake was uncovered in 2006, after an enquiry by Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, a professor of art history at the University of Delaware.  The university's conservation department undertook restoration of the work.[72]

Because of deterioration in the condition of Géricault's original, the Louvre in 1859–60 commissioned two French artists, Pierre-Désiré Guillemet and Étienne-Antoine-Eugène Ronjat [fr], to make a full size copy of the original for loan exhibitions.[70]

In the autumn of 1939, the Medusa was packed for removal from the Louvre in anticipation of the outbreak of war.  A scenery truck from the Comédie-Française transported the painting to Versailles in the night of 3 September.  Some time later, the Medusa was moved to the Château de Chambord where it remained until after the end of the Second World War.[73]

In its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth, The Raft of the Medusa was a landmark in the emerging Romantic movement in French painting, and ""laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution""[74] against the prevailing Neoclassical style.  Géricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular history painting genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style.[75] In France, both history painting and the Neoclassical style continued through the work of Antoine-Jean Gros, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, François Gérard, Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson, Pierre-Narcisse Guérin—teacher of both Géricault and Delacroix—and other artists who remained committed to the artistic traditions of David and Nicolas Poussin.

In his introduction to The Journal of Eugène Delacroix, Hubert Wellington wrote about Delacroix's opinion of the state of French painting just prior to the Salon of 1819. According to Wellington, ""The curious blend of classic with realistic outlook which had been imposed by the discipline of David was now losing both animation and interest. The master himself was nearing his end, and exiled in Belgium. His most docile pupil, Girodet, a refined and cultivated classicist, was producing pictures of astonishing frigidity. Gérard, immensely successful painter of portraits under the Empire—some of them admirable—fell in with the new vogue for large pictures of history, but without enthusiasm.""[42]

The Raft of the Medusa contains the gestures and grand scale of traditional history painting; however, it presents ordinary people, rather than heroes, reacting to the unfolding drama.[76] Géricault's raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, ""the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism"".[21]

The artist's abolitionist views are said to have been expressed in his decision to prominently feature at least two Black individuals, particularly the dominant figure seen waving a dark red handkerchief. According to scholars Klaus Berger and Diane Chalmers Johnson, Géricault made ""him the focal point of the drama, the strongest and most perceptive of the survivors, in a sense, the 'hero of the scene.'""[45] They argue that the artist's choice to do so was not a ""last-minute"" decision as evidenced by early sketches for the work, including a portrait study of the Haitian model Joseph, and point to Géricault's concerns regarding the ""extreme cruelties"" of illegal slave trade in the French colonies.[45] The subject of marine tragedy was undertaken by J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), who, like many English artists, probably saw Géricault's painting when it was exhibited in London in 1820.[77][78] His A Disaster at Sea (c. 1835) chronicled a similar incident, this time a British catastrophe, with a swamped vessel and dying figures also placed in the foreground. Placing a person of color in the centre of the drama was revisited by Turner, with similar abolitionist overtones, in his The Slave Ship (1840).[77]

The unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications of the extent to which Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.[27]

Hubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for Géricault. The dramatic composition of Géricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, ""Géricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa while he was still working on it.""[42] The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's The Barque of Dante (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840).[74]

According to Wellington, Delacroix's masterpiece of 1830, Liberty Leading the People, springs directly from Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa and Delacroix's own Massacre at Chios. Wellington wrote that ""While Géricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions.""[79]

The art historian Albert Elsen believed that The Raft of the Medusa and Delacroix's  Massacre at Chios provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of Auguste Rodin's monumental sculpture The Gates of Hell. He wrote that ""Delacroix's Massacre at Chios and Géricault's Raft of the Medusa confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies ... If Rodin was inspired to rival Michelangelo's Last Judgment, he had Géricault's Raft of the Medusa in front of him for encouragement.""[80]

While Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) could be described as an anti-Romantic painter, his major works like A Burial at Ornans (1849–50) and The Artist's Studio (1855) owe a debt to The Raft of the Medusa. The influence is not only in Courbet's enormous scale, but in his willingness to portray ordinary people and current political events,[81] and to record people, places and events in real, everyday surroundings. The 2004 exhibition at the Clark Art Institute,  Bonjour Monsieur Courbet: The Bruyas Collection from the Musee Fabre, Montpellier, sought to compare the 19th-century Realist painters Courbet, Honoré Daumier (1808–1879), and early Édouard Manet (1832–1883) with artists associated with Romanticism, including Géricault and Delacroix. Citing The Raft of the Medusa as an instrumental influence on Realism, the exhibition drew comparisons between all of the artists.[82] The critic Michael Fried sees Manet directly borrowing the figure of the man cradling his son for the composition of Angels at the Tomb of Christ.[83]

The influence of The Raft of the Medusa was felt by artists beyond France. Francis Danby, a British painter born in Ireland, probably was inspired by Géricault's picture when he painted Sunset at Sea after a Storm in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that The Raft of the Medusa was ""the finest and grandest historical picture I have ever seen"".[84]

The Gulf Stream (1899), by the American artist Winslow Homer (1836–1910), replicates the composition of The Raft of the Medusa with a damaged vessel, ominously surrounded by sharks and threatened by a waterspout. Like Géricault, Homer makes a black man the pivotal figure in the scene, though here he is the vessel's sole occupant. A ship in the distance mirrors the Argus from Géricault's painting.[85] The move from the drama of Romanticism to the new Realism is exemplified by the stoic resignation of Homer's figure.[86] The man's condition, which in earlier works might have been characterised by hope or helplessness, has turned to ""sullen rage"".[85]

In the early 1990s, sculptor John Connell, in his Raft Project, a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated The Raft of the Medusa by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and tar and placing them on a large wooden raft.[87]

Remarking on the contrast between the dying figures in the foreground and the figures in the mid-ground waving towards the approaching rescue ship, the French art historian Georges-Antoine Borias wrote that Géricault's painting represents, ""on the one hand, desolation and death. On the other, hope and life.""[88]

For Kenneth Clark, The Raft of the Medusa ""remains the chief example of romantic pathos expressed through the nude; and that obsession with death, which drove Géricault to frequent mortuary chambers and places of public execution, gives truth to his figures of the dead and the dying. Their outlines may be taken from the classics, but they have been seen again with a craving for violent experience.""[50]

Today, a bronze bas-relief of The Raft of the Medusa by Antoine Étex adorns Géricault's grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.[89]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24118,"The Clubfoot (also known as The Club-Footed Boy) is a 1642 oil on canvas painting by Jusepe de Ribera. It is housed in the Musée du Louvre in Paris (part of the La Caze bequest of 1869), and was painted in Naples. Art historian Ellis Waterhouse wrote of it as ""a touchstone by which we can interpret the whole of Ribera's art"".[2]

Commissioned by a Flemish dealer, the painting features a Neapolitan beggar boy with a deformed foot. Behind him is a vast and luminous landscape, against which the boy stands with a gap-toothed grin, wearing earth-toned clothes and holding his crutch slung over his left shoulder. Written in Latin on the paper in the boy's hand is the sentence ""DA MIHI ELEMOSINAM PROPTER AMOREM DEI"" (""Give me alms, for the love of God""). 

This is one of the painter's last works, and one of the most bitter. The contrast of light and shade gave him pleasure. He studied the composition of the Renaissance painters in Italy, and perhaps also the work of Flemish artists, but in spite of all that, he clung to the profoundly Spanish tradition of realism, even after having spent nearly all his life in Italy.[3]

Moved by a Christian awareness of human weakness, Spanish artists often painted pictures of the poor and disabled. Here the young Neapolitan vagabond seems to be making game of his own infirmity; he is also careful to inform us, by means of the scrap of writing he holds, that he is dumb as well as crippled, because he appeals to the charity of the passer-by with that card written in Latin.[4]

The motif is surely a derivation of taste for scenes of low life in art, as instituted by Caravaggio and followed by Ribera, who was in Naples his most fervent admirer in the realist vein.[5]

Women of Algiers in their Apartment (French: Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartement) is the title of two oil on canvas paintings by the French Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix.

Delacroix's first version of Women of Algiers was painted in Paris in 1834 and is located in the Louvre, Paris, France. The second work, painted fifteen years later between 1847 and 1849, is located at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier, France. The two works both depict the same scene of four women together in an enclosed room. Despite the similar setting, the two paintings evoke completely different moods through the depiction of the women. Delacroix's earlier 1834 work captures the separation between the women and the viewer. The second painting instead invites the viewer into the scene through the warm inviting gaze of the women.

Women of Algiers, along with Delacroix's other Orientalist paintings, has inspired many artists of later generations. In 1888 both Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin travelled to Montpellier to view Delacroix's 1849 version of Women of Algiers.[1] The painting served as a source of inspiration to the later impressionists,[2] and a series of 15 paintings and numerous drawings by Pablo Picasso in 1954.[3]

Paul Cézanne described Delacroix's intoxicating colour plays as ""All this luminous colour... It seems to me that it enters the eye like a glass of wine running into your gullet and it makes you drunk straight away"".[4]
The 1834 painting was first displayed at the 1834 Salon in Paris, where it received mixed reviews. The art critic Gustave Plance wrote in a review for Revue des deux mondes that Delacroix's painting Femmes d'Alger dans leur Appartement was about painting and nothing more, painting that is fresh, vigorous, advanced with spirit, and of an audacity completely venetian, yet yielding nothing to the masters it recalls.[5] King Louis Philippe purchased the painting in 1834 and presented it to the Musée du Luxembourg. In 1874 the painting was moved to the Louvre, Paris where it remains today as part of the permanent collection.[6]

The work depicts four women enclosed in a lavishly decorated room. Three of the women are sumptuously adorned with loose, billowing garments and gold jewellery. One woman has a pink flower in her hair. The fourth woman is a black enslaved person who exits the scene, looking over her left shoulder towards the seated women. Delacroix perfectly rendered the features of the women's clothing, adornments, and the interior decor in great detail.  This attention to details follows through from his 1832 Algerian sketches into the 1834 oil painting of the same scene. The painting has been applauded by scholars for its attempted ethnographic depiction, both in the relatively clothed forms of the females and the title of the painting itself, as it is devoid of the objectifying terms odalisque or harem.[7] Delacroix's Women of Algiers does not depict an overtly eroticized version of the Oriental female, as other artists did, such as Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres' salacious depiction in his 1814 painting Grande Odalisque.

Although there is a desire for realism to evoke the decorative mood, the work fails to extend the desire for realism to the women themselves, and the social customs of the harem. There is almost no narrative in the stagnant space. The women are cloistered together, not engaging with one another. The challenging stare of the women on the left reflects hostility towards the permeation of the private space. Aside from this glance there is no depiction of the nineteenth century social customs of the harems of elite Algerian culture. Ultimately Delacroix's stolen glance into the Algerian harem provided him with little visual information to create a realistic image.

With these gaps in visual information Delacroix fills the voids with his own European interpretation, resulting in a subtler version of the fantasy female. With the exposed décolletage, loose unbounded clothing and languid poses, Delacroix's Algerian females are still situated in the European oriental dream. The addition of stereotypical Orientalist motifs, such as the narghile pipe, charcoal burner, and the odalisques pose.  Together they create a fictional image that parallels the European fantasy of the harem more than reality. The nineteenth century European viewer's connotations of the ""narghile pipe"" with smoking hashish or opium, as well as the connotations of the loose unbound clothing to sexual immorality, added to this Western fantasy.

The French conquest of Algeria started in 1830 and affected France's relationship with nearby countries, such as Morocco.[8] Towards the end of 1831 King Louis Phillipe sent a diplomatic party to Morocco in order to establish friendly relations and negotiate a treaty with the Sultan. He assigned the young diplomat Charles de Mornay. At that time it was common to take artists along, in order to visually document the journey.[9] Delacroix joined the diplomatic party by chance through social connections. Previously, when Delacroix was studying under Pierre Guérin, he had become friends with a fellow student, Henri Duponchel, who had recently become director of scenic design at the Paris Opera (and would later become its managing director). Duponchel was in the social circle of Mornay's mistress, the actress Mademoiselle Mars, and recommended Delacroix for this assignment.[10][11]

Delacroix joined the party and together they set sail in 1831 and arrived in Tangiers, Morocco, on 25 January 1832.[12] Delacroix greatly relished the atmosphere, the colours, the objects, the people, and the architecture of this exotic world. Delacroix recorded everything in his journals.[11] During his six-month trip Delacroix filled seven large sketchbooks and created an album of eighteen watercolours.[13] Delacroix was invited into Jewish households to sketch. His 1832 journal recounts in detail the clothing, interior décor, and festivities of the Jewish households and he drew several small sketches of the Jewish families and households.[14] From these he later painted the works Jewish Wedding in Morocco (c.1841) and Jewish Bride (c.1832). Delacroix found it significantly harder to sketch Arabic women, due to religious constrictions. Despite this setback Delacroix still attempted to sketch the Arabic women. As soon as he would seek to sketch them from afar, the Arabic women who would hang their washing out on roof terraces would immediately alert their husbands.[6]

Delacroix returned home via Spain, and Algeria, where he stayed for three days. By luck he was at the Algerian port where he met a merchant who gave him access to his households private harem. Delacroix created two small sketches of the women in the Algerian harem that he later used to create his oil painting Women of Algiers.[15]

The nineteenth century concept of North Africa was a warped and fantasised interpretation of the foreign countries. Ottoman Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and India were all condensed under the enigmatic category of ""The Orient"". It was perceived as a timeless, exotic land of fantasy and adventure. This ignorant understanding had been developing since the seventeenth century with the introduction of Chinese and Japanese culture and aesthetics into Europe by the Jesuits.[16] Many fictional works were paraded as fact, such as Montesquieu's 1721 book Persian Letters. A fictional set of correspondence that satirically recounted the European character's response to North Africa.[17] These books, as well as other paintings, drawings, literature, photographs, and travel diaries, created preconceptions that coloured the travelling artists interpretation of their surroundings in North Africa. French Orientalist painting took off with Napoleon's Egyptian campaign of 1798, the year in which Delacroix was born. French fascination again increased during the Greek revolution in 1821–30, during which time Victor Hugo authored the volume of poems Les Orientales and Delacroix contributed two paintings, The Massacre at Chios (1824) and Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Messolonghi (1826).

By the nineteenth century this warped myth had developed into a perceived truth and each subsequent piece of information on North Africa validated, and in turn propagated this Oriental myth. European depiction of the harem was almost perpetually dependent on the Oriental myth. European male artists were unable to obtain access to the harem and so relied upon visits to brothels and their own imagination to conjure a fantasy image of the space. Research has shown that even first hand accounts by female artists and writers who had the opportunity to enter local harems were slightly embellished.[18] These fantasy depictions regularly eroticized and objectified the spaces, see Jean-Léon Gérôme's 1876 Pool in a harem, for example. Eugène Delacroix had the benefit of physically visiting a harem in 1832, albeit very briefly.

The European myth of the harem fantasy intensified in the nineteenth century with the ready availability of the book Arabian Nights (also known as Thousand and One Nights). Antoine Galland first translated it into French in 1717.[19] The enormously popular book of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries painted a picture of a timeless fantasy world of exotic adventure. The influence of this tale on travelling artist's first hand absorption and interpretation of visual information is discussed in Mary Roberts's book Intimate Outsiders.[20]

Delacroix himself paralleled his experiences in North Africa to the Arabian Nights. In a letter to Alexis de Tocqueville several years after his trip he mentioned, ""Never in my life have I observed anything more bizarre than the first sight of Tangier. It is a tale out of the Thousand and One Nights... A prodigious mix of races and costumes...This whole world moves about with an activity that seems feverish.""[21]

The second painting was created between 1847 and 1849 and currently resides at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France. The composition of the figures remains the same, however the women are now depicted as smaller figures and fade back into the background. The melody of gold, burnt umber, and red tones blending together creates a hazy, dreamlike reverie. Instead of leaving the scene the black slave is now lifting away the curtain to reveal the seated women to the viewer. The women on the left wears a lower plunging neckline revealing her décolletage and she now stares softly at the viewer with a warm, inviting gaze.

The second painting was created fifteen years after the 1834 original. In comparison, the viewer can see the influence of time and nostalgia upon the interpretation of visual information. The slightly fantasied scene has been transformed into a picture of pure nostalgia. The European concept of the harem further implants itself within Delacroix's work, ultimately creating a painting that objectifies and eroticizes the Algerian women to a greater extent than the original 1834 version.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56678956,"Self-Portrait is an undated work by the Southern Italian artist from Naples, Salvator Rosa. It was most probably painted during Rosa's stay in Florence between 1640 and 1649, although a claim has been made that it was painted in the early 1660s. The self-portrait belongs to the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France, to which it was presented in 1987 by the collectors Othon Kaufmann and François Schlageter, together with other Italian Baroque paintings such as Bononi's Saint Sebastian and the Angel. Its inventory number is 44.987.3.7.[2]

The painting depicts Rosa not as a painter, but as a poet laureate. It had belonged to the collection of nobleman Filippo Niccolini of the Florentine Niccolini Family [it] and was later purchased by Kaufmann and Schlageter through the Venetian art dealer Ettore Viancini.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1213917,"The Church at Auvers is an oil painting created by Dutch post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh in June 1890 which now hangs in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France.

The actual church is in Place de l'Eglise, Auvers-sur-Oise, France, 27 kilometres (17 mi) north-west of Paris.

The Church at Auvers — along with other canvases such as The Town Hall at Auvers and several drawings of small houses with thatched roofs — is reminiscent of scenes from his Nuenen period.[1]  A certain nostalgia for the north had already been apparent in his last weeks in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence: in a letter written a couple of weeks before his departure, he wrote ""While I was ill I nevertheless did some little canvases from memory which you will see later, memories of the North.""[2]

He specifically refers to similar work done back at Nuenen when he describes this painting in a letter to his sister Wilhelmina on 5 June 1890:

I have a larger picture of the village church — an effect in which the building appears to be violet-hued against a sky of simple deep blue colour, pure cobalt; the stained-glass windows appear as ultramarine blotches, the roof is violet and partly orange. In the foreground some green plants in bloom, and sand with the pink flow of sunshine in it. And once again it is nearly the same thing as the studies I did in Nuenen of the old tower and the cemetery, only it is probably that now the colour is more expressive, more sumptuous.[3]
The ""simple deep blue"" was also used in Portrait of Adeline Ravoux, painted in the same short period in Auvers-sur-Oise.

The foreground of The Church at Auvers is brightly lit by the sun, but the church itself sits in its own shadow, and ""neither reflects nor emanates any light of its own.""[4] After Van Gogh had been dismissed from the evangelical career he had hoped to continue in the Borinage, Belgium, he wrote to his brother Theo from Cuesmes in July 1880, and quoted Shakespeare's image from Henry IV, Part 1[5] of the dark emptiness inside a church to symbolize ""empty and unenlightened preaching"":[6] ""Their God is like the God of Shakespeare's drunken Falstaff, 'the inside of a church'""[7]

The motif of diverging paths also appears in his painting Wheat Field with Crows.

The Church at Auvers plays a prominent role in ""Vincent and the Doctor"", a 2010 episode of the British science-fiction television programme Doctor Who, although the scenes at the church were filmed at Llandaff Cathedral in Wales.[citation needed]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3808227,"Young Girls at the Piano (French: Jeunes filles au piano) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. The painting was completed in 1892 as an informal commission for the Musée du Luxembourg. Renoir painted three other variations of this composition in oil and two sketches, one in oil and one in pastel. Known by the artist as repetitions, they were executed to fulfill commissions from dealers and collectors.[1] The work is on public display at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris.

Renoir depicts two young girls at a piano in a bourgeois home, one in a white dress with blue sash seated playing and one in a pink dress standing. Renoir completed three additional versions of this composition in oil for collectors; the Luxembourg version is now housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris,[2] the Robert Lehman Collection version is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,[3] while the Caillebotte version and one other are in private collections. An oil sketch of the composition is on display at the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris and a pastel sketch is in a private collection.[4] The painting in the Musée d'Orsay is 116 cm high and 90 cm wide. The version at the Met is 111.8 x 86.4 cm. The oil sketch at the Musée de l'Orangerie is 116.0 x 81.0 cm.[5]

Pissarro and Monet routinely painted series of variations on a single theme, but their works were intended to be shown together to chronicle the effects of light and atmosphere, while Renoir’s repetitions were independent essays in composition.[6] In particular, details and poses changed subtly, and the sketches eliminate most of the background elements.

Renoir explored a similar composition with his earlier 1888 work The Daughters of Catulle Mendès, now in the Annenberg Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3904400,"Pietà is a c.1537-1540 oil painting by Rosso Fiorentino, originally painted on panel and later transferred to canvas. Now in the Louvre in Paris, it is the only securely-identified original painting by the artist known to have been produced for a courtier of Francis I of France. X-ray examination has shown an initial composition under the bodies of Christ and St John.[1]

According to Vasari's Lives of the Artists, it was commissioned by constable Anne de Montmorency soon after the artist's work on the Francis I Gallery at Fontainebleau Palace. De Montmorency's coat of arms features on the pillow under Christ and it was originally at the doorway to the chapel in his Château d'Écouen, from which it was moved to the Louvre at the end of the 18th century.

The body of Christ is represented in the foreground and, semi-extended, occupies the entire surface of the painting. He is echoed by Mary who, desperate, spreads her arms reaching to touch the edges of the painting and symbolically reliving the martyrdom of the crucifixion. It is held by a pious woman with her head covered by a heavy veil of bright red color, while Jesus is held at the feet by the Magdalene, with very refined clothing and hairstyle, and by John the Apostle, represented kneeling from behind on the right in a complex twist, complementary to that of the Magdalene. The figures occupy practically the entire available field, leaving little space for the dark background that simulates the open sepulcher. They have a heroic and dramatic tone, highlighted by the gestures, but austerely restrained, which Antonio Natali defined as ""a chorus of Greek tragedy"".

The light lingers grazing on the foreground of the composition, leaving the background in darkness, and lighting up various shades of red in the clothing of the characters, contrasted by the white band that wraps around Mary's neck and head, as well as the yellow of the dress of the Magdalene and the whiteness of her lace. The folds of the clothes appear hard, almost sculpted, more sharp than ever.

More than the sophisticated style of Fontainebleau's works, the  Pietà  recalls the torments of works such as the Sansepolcro Deposition (1528), especially in the pose of the figures. This has led to the hypothesis of a previous dating than the traditional one, at the beginning of the French stay. The hypothesis, however, contrasts with the documents that recall the construction of the Constable's chapel, completed in the 1540s.

Large in size (265 x 403.5 cm) it has been exhibited at the Musée d'Orsay since 1977.[1] The painting depicts the return of a fishing boat with a lateen sail. Two oxen tow the boat on a beach surrounded by fishermen.

The canvas was acquired by the French State in 1895 at the Salon for 6000 francs.[2] It was successively exhibited at the Musée du Luxembourg, the Louvre (1922), the Musée national d'art moderne (1946) until 1977 when it was attributed to the Louvre and since then exhibited at the Musée d'Orsay.[1]

The painting has been exhibited internationally many times, including notably:[1]

The scene takes place by the sea, when a fishing boat returns to El Cabañal beach, in Valencia.[3] In the center of the composition, two oxen in the foreground pull a Catalan boat.[4] The flapping sail is inflated by the wind and seems to help them. On the left in the foreground, a fisherman waits with a plank, probably the one on which the boat will be placed when the time comes. Another sailor is seated on the neck of one of the oxen which he seems to be guiding. In the background, in the shadows, another sailor is watching in the boat. Finally, in the background, in the light, a last fisherman in the boat adjusts a sheet so that the wind facilitates the maneuver.[3]

The entire composition stands out against blue backgrounds (sea below, sky above). Sorolla brings out bursts of light from the chiaroscuros caused by the shadow of the sail.

The painting was a resounding success with city dwellers seduced by “its Mediterranean atmosphere [...] the manual work and liveliness”. The painter received the highest distinction awarded at the exhibition, and the canvas was purchased by the Musée du Luxembourg.[3][5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3349704,"

The Charging Chasseur, or An Officer of the Imperial Horse Guards Charging, is an oil painting on canvas executed ca.  1812 by the French painter Théodore Géricault,  portraying a mounted Napoleonic cavalry officer who is ready to attack.

The painting was Géricault's first exhibited work and it is an example of his attempt to condense both movement and structure in his art.[1] It represents French romanticism and has a motif similar to Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps, but non-classical characteristics of the picture include its dramatic diagonal arrangement and vigorous paint handling.

In The Charging Chasseur, the horse appears to be rearing away from an unseen attacker. The turning figure on a rearing horse is derived from the large early Rubens Saint George (Museo del Prado, 1605–1607), though there the view is from the side.

Géricault would continue to move away from classicism, as exemplified in his later masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa (1818–19).

Black American artist Kehinde Wiley reimagined The Charging Chasseur in his 2007 painting Officer of the Hussars. In Officer of the Hussars, a young Black man dressed in a sleeveless shirt, jeans, and Timberland boots sits atop the horse.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1215604,"The Source (French: La Source, meaning ""spring"") is an oil painting on canvas by French neoclassical painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. The work was begun in Florence around 1820 and not completed until 1856, in Paris.[1][2] When Ingres completed The Source, he was seventy-six years old,[3] already famous,[4] and president of the École des Beaux-Arts.[5] The pose of the nude may be compared with that of another by Ingres, the Venus Anadyomene (1848),[6] and is a reimagination of the Aphrodite of Cnidus or Venus Pudica.[5] Two of Ingres' students, painters Paul Balze and Alexandre Desgoffe, helped to create the background and water jar.[1]

The painting depicts a nude standing upright between an opening in the rocks and holding in her hands a pitcher, from which water flows. She thus represents a water source or spring, for which source is the normal French word, and which, in classical literature, is sacred to the Muses and a source of poetic inspiration.[7] She stands between two flowers, with their ""vulnerability to males who wish to pluck them"",[7] and is framed by ivy, plant of Dionysus the god of disorder, regeneration, and ecstasy.[7] The water she pours out separates her from the viewer, as rivers mark boundaries of which the crossing is symbolically important.[7]

Art historians Frances Fowle and Richard Thomson suggest that there is a ""symbolic unity of woman and nature"" in The Source, where the flowering plants and water serve as a background which Ingres fills with woman's ""secondary attributes"".[8]

The first exhibition of The Source was in 1856, the year it was completed.[9] The painting was received enthusiastically.[4] Duchâtel acquired the painting in 1857 for a sum of 25,000 francs. The state assumed title to the painting in 1878 and it passed to the Musée du Louvre. In 1986 it was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay.[1] The painting has been frequently exhibited and widely published.[1][10]

Haldane Macfall in A History of Painting: The French Genius describes The Source as Ingres' ""superb nude by which he is chiefly known"".[11] Kenneth Clark in his book Feminine Beauty observed how The Source has been described as ""the most beautiful figure in French painting.""[12] Walter Friedländer in David to Delacroix referred to The Source simply as the most famous of Ingres' paintings.[13]

The model for the painting was the young daughter of Ingres' concierge.[11] In his Confessions of a Young Man, Irish novelist George Moore wrote, with relation to the morality of artistic production, ""What care I that the virtue of some sixteen-year-old maid was the price for Ingres' La Source? That the model died of drink and disease in the hospital is nothing when compared with the essential that I should have La Source, that exquisite dream of innocence.""[14]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3399440,"Portrait of Louis XIV in Coronation Robes was painted in 1701 by the French painter Hyacinthe Rigaud after being commissioned by the king who wanted to satisfy the desire of his grandson, Philip V, for a portrait of him. Louis XIV kept it hanging at Versailles.
It has since become the most recognisable portrait of the king.

On the death of King Charles II of Spain on 18 November 1700, Spain was beset by the dynastic ambitions of other European powers, resulting in a succession war. The Spanish king's will ruled out any idea of sharing and placed Philip, Duke of Anjou, second son of the Grand Dauphin and grand-son of Louis XIV at the forefront of legitimate contenders for the crown.
The future king of Spain, eager to take with him the image of his grandfather, convinced Louis XIV to order Hyacinthe Rigaud to paint what would become the absolute image of royal power and the reference picture for generations to come:

His reputation [Rigaud's] having reached the king, because of the portrait he had done of the Grand Dauphin as commander at the siege of Philippsburg, he had the honor in 1700, to be appointed by His Majesty to paint Philip V, king of Spain, his grandson, a few days before his departure to take possession of his kingdom. This work inspired the king of Spain's request to the king, his grandfather, to give him his portrait painted by the same hand, which His Majesty granted him. Rigaud had the honor to start the following year; and when it was finished, the monarch found the resemblance so perfect and so beautifully decorated, he ordered Rigaud to make a copy of the same size, to send to the king of Spain, instead of the original. His Most Christian Majesty is painted standing, clad in his royal apparel. This picture is ten and a half feet high; it is located in Versailles, in the throne room, and the picture of the king of Spain is in the private room of His Majesty.[1]
Such were the statements of Hyacinthe Rigaud, through a friend, in the autobiography he sent to the Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosimo III in 1716.[2][3]
These statements are corroborated by the mention of the corresponding payment in the books of accounts of the artist, in 1701: ""The King and the King of Spain, and a copy of King's portrait of the same size as the original for his Catholic Majesty, in all 12,000 pounds "", the price of three pictures.[4]  The same payment is charged to the royal buildings accounts on September 16, 1702: ""Two large portraits of the King full-length, with the small sketch for the said portraits, as well as one for the full-length portrait of the king of Spain.""[5]

It seems that Philip V had obtained satisfaction through the intercession of Madame de Maintenon, who in a letter to the Duke of Noailles, dated March 11, 1701 wrote:

""I am working to send him the portrait which he has ordered me to make him do. Here are two after-dinners that I return from Saint-Cyr to oblige the King to be painted. Gout came to our rescue. Without it we will not have held him for three or four hours""[6]
The day before, the Marquis de Dangeau left in his journal testimony corroborating the statements of Mme de Maintenon, describing the beginning of the Louis XIV painting, painted in privacy and designed to be embedded later into the final composition:

""Thursday 10 [March 1701] at Versailles - The King's gout continues, he was painted after dinner by Rigaud to send his portrait to the King of Spain to whom he promised him  [...].[7] ""The next day, the work actually continued:"" Friday 11 at Versailles - The King's gout grew a little, and on leaving the sermon, where he was carried, he was carried back to Madame de Maintenon's, where Rigaud worked on his portrait..""
On September 3, 1703, in a touching letter he wrote to the Marquise, Philip V in turn confessed: 

""Thank you for the care you took to get me the portrait of the king, I look forward...[8]""
The size and complexity of the composition justified the expectations of the sponsors and the time spent by the artist to complete his work. All the evidence is that Rigaud painted from life while completing the portrait, which never did get sent to Spain.

Thursday, January 19, 1702, Rigaud is seeking a new session, wrote the Marquis de Dangeau: 

""the King, who had no advice to keep, had the patience to be painted at Madame de Maintenon's by Rigaud; he sends this portrait to the King of Spain, who had urged on "".
""The portrait of the King has been exhibited in the great apartment of Versailles; It is full with the royal habit. This work is by M. Rigaud. Never has a portrait been better painted, nor more resembling; The whole court saw it and everyone admired it. A work must be very beautiful and perfect to attract general applause in a place where good taste reigns and where one is not lavish of praise. His Majesty has promised his portrait to the King of Spain, wants to keep his word by giving him the original, and Mr. Rigaud must make a copy that is desired by the entire Court .""[9]
The director of the King's Buildings ordered from the painter's studio a number of copies (in various forms for European courts or provincial royal dispensaries, such as that commissioned by François Stiémart, for example) or engravings, proved by a payment order dated September 16, 1702: ""To Sieur Rigaud, ordinary painter of the King, for two large portraits of the King in full, with the sketch in small of the said portraits, as also of the full-length portrait of the King of Spain he made during the current year, 10,000 livres"".[10]

Pierre Drevet was appointed to carry out the engravings and receives ""perfect payment of five thousand livres for the engraving [ sic ] he made of the portrait at the foot of the King Louis XIV, according to M. Rigaud, during 1714-1715.""[11]
To do this, Drevet been assisted by a drawing executed by the young Jean-Marc Nattier and to who the director of buildings records payment, on August 20, 1713: 

""to the Sr Nattier the young, painter, for the drawing of a portrait of the king after Rigaud, which he copied to serve as a model for engraving during 1713, [...] 500 livres""[12]
Drevet owes a great deal to Nattier's work, which has recreated Rigaud's painting to its smallest details, to the projected dimensions of an etching. However, it extended the marble gallery in the background slightly, a variation followed by the engraver. There is no doubt that Rigaud himself supervised Nattier's work, since the drawing was intended for his friend Prevet, and Marc's father, Natier 
Mariette considers the work of Drevet as ""what [the artist] has made more considerable"" and that she "" engraved by order of his very Christian Majesty and Estre put in his Cabinet.""[13] In 1733, he noted the rarity in a letter to Gabburri: ""For my part I can encourage you to acquire a portrait of the reigning king and the queen, but the one engraved by Drevet is very difficult to have, and I have it Seen for sale at more than eight livres. I can have it for a discreet price but I have to give me time.""[14]

Signed and dated, ""Painted by Hyacinthe Rigaud in 1701"" on the base of the column supporting the goddess of Justice, and with Themis holding a set of scales in her hand, this vast portrait is that of an aging (64 years old) King, having reached the summit of his glory.

Rigaud executed the face on a small rectangular canvas subsequently sewn in small dots onto a larger canvas painted with the figure and background.[15]
This original, now in the Louvre 3, from the crown collections,[16] has a replica (now shown in the Apollo Room of the Palace of Versailles ), also signed although of slightly different dimensions than the original.[17][18] One can also find a copy at the Hotel Negresco.
The king is depicted standing upright, three quarters to the left, his head low and his feet in view, a pose calculated to presenting the greater part of his person. The king occupies the central space of the painting whose composition is constructed from vertical lines (column, king, throne) and a pyramid in which the sovereign inscribes, which creates an elevated space. The drama of the scene is accentuated by a heavy draped curtain which traditionally means that the king does not appear but appears. A large marble pillar, traditional evocation of power since the Renaissance (as a stability symbol, the world axis that unites the earthly and heavenly powers) holds the composition left. The massive barrel rests on a stylobate whose two visible sides are decorated with reliefs depicting two royal virtues: The allegories of Justice (front) and strength (left, very difficult to see).[19]

Stood before a throne upholstered in blue and embroidered with fleur de lys placed high up on a platform and under a purple (the color of power and wealth since antiquity) silk canopy, the king embodies the majesty of choice because he need not bear regalia (he is uncrowned, the hand of justice posed on a stool covered with a blue fleur de lys drapery, scepter of his grandfather Henry IV held upside down as a cane), except to the sword of Charlemagne whose sole custody is visible.[20] Wearing this sword with the coronation mantle is an obvious incongruity.[21] The monarch is clothed in a leonine wig and court garments ( lace shirt and cuffs, brocade rhingraves, red - heeled shoes adorned with diamond buckles, and silk stockings held by garters ) wears the necklace of the Order the Holy Spirit and the royal coat pinned high on the shoulder to highlight the former sword dancer and his thin legs as Louis XIV had insisted that his features be ""true"" [22][23]

A copy of this portrait, made by Pierre Legendre, is in the library of the Palais Rohan, Strasbourg, opposite the portrait of Louis XV, also in costume de sacre. 
Another copy is present at the Paris Observatory, between portraits of Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Urbain Le Verrier.

There's one copy at the J. Paul Getty Museum in LA and one at the Versailles Palace.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q673112,"Apollo and Daphnis is a c.1483 mythological painting by Perugino. It was sold to the Louvre in Paris in 1883, where it still hangs and in whose catalogue it was known as Apollo and Marsyas.[1] By the 1880s it had become misattributed to Raphael.

It one of the most notable works commissioned from the artist by Lorenzo de' Medici. In the background is a rural scene with a city or castle, a three-arch bridge, trees typical of Perugino, hills and a river. The two nude figures in the foreground allude to that in ancient Greek and Roman art - this and the other classical references demonstrate how the work is intended to be decoded by the humanist classical elite of Florence. The standing contrapposto figure is the god Apollo, carrying a baton in his left hand and with a bow and quiver behind him. His pose draws on that of Hermes in a sculpture of Hermes and Dionysius by Praxiteles, now best known from the copy Hermes and the Infant Dionysus rediscovered in the 19th century.

The identity of the seated flute-playing figure on the left is debated - it may be Marsyas,[2] but that character is usually depicted as a satyr and so it may instead by Daphnis, a young shepherd who died of love for Apollo. Daphnis is the Greek form of the name Laurus, possibly linking the work to Lorenzo de' Medici. His pose draws on a sculpture of Hermes by Lysippus, best known from the Seated Hermes discovered in 1758.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2622172,"The Bellelli Family, also known as Family Portrait, is an oil painting on canvas by Edgar Degas (1834–1917), painted c. 1858–1867, and housed in the Musée d'Orsay. A masterwork of Degas' youth, the painting is a portrait of his aunt, her husband, and their two young daughters. 

While finishing his artistic training in Italy, Degas drew and painted his aunt Laura, her husband the baron Gennaro Bellelli (1812–1864), and their daughters Giulia and Giovanna. Although it is not known for certain when or where Degas executed the painting, it is believed that he utilized studies done in Italy to complete the work after his return to Paris.[1] Laura, his father's sister, is depicted in a dress which symbolizes mourning for her father, who had recently died and appears in the framed portrait behind her. The baron was an Italian patriot exiled from Naples, living in Florence.

Laura Bellelli's countenance is dignified and austere, her gesture connected with those of her daughters. Her husband, by contrast, appears to be separated from his family. His association with business and the outside world is implied by his position at his desk. Giulia holds a livelier pose than that of her sister Giovanna, whose restraint appears to underscore the familial tensions.

In 1856 Degas left his home in Paris to study art and visit family relations in Italy, arriving in Naples on 17 July. In 1857 he traveled between Naples, where he stayed with his grandfather, Hilaire Degas, and Rome. At the end of July 1858 Laura Bellelli wrote to Degas from Naples, inviting him to stay with her in Florence; it was there that Gennaro Bellelli, who had been a political journalist supporting the fight for Italy's independence, took refuge from Austrian persecution after defeat of the Revolution of 1848.[2] Degas arrived in Florence by 4 August, living with his uncle Gennaro and making studies in the Uffizi.[3] By September he had become bored, did not get along well with Gennaro,[4] and remained only to see Laura, Giovanna, and Giulia, who had prolonged their stay in Naples following the death of Degas' grandfather Hilaire on 31 August.[3]

That there were strains within the Bellelli household at the time was almost certainly noticed by Degas, and confirmed by another uncle: ""The domestic life of the family in Florence is a source of unhappiness for us. As I predicted, one of them is very much at fault and our sister a little, too.""[5] Laura subsequently confided to Degas that, living in exile, she missed her Neapolitan family, and further, that her husband was ""immensely disagreeable and dishonest... Living with Gennaro, whose detestable nature you know and who has no serious occupation, shall soon lead me to the grave.""[1] Laura Bellelli was pregnant at the time, and it has been suggested that this circumstance, and the subsequent death of the child in infancy, may have contributed to her unhappiness and to domestic tensions in general.[6] These conflicts would provide both background and content for the painting.


After his aunt and cousins returned in early November 1858, Degas undertook a series of works that would eventually culminate in The Bellelli Family.[4] It appears that he initially planned to paint a vertical composition depicting his aunt and her two daughters in a pyramidical grouping.[7]  He painted his cousins in their black dresses and white pinafores, while his father wrote letters from Paris, offering advice on how best to proceed with the project, and impatiently awaited his return.[4] Degas wrote of Giulia and Giovanna:
""The elder one was in fact a little beauty. The younger one, on the other hand, was smart as can be and kind as an angel. I am painting them in mourning dress and small white aprons, which suit them very well…I would like to express a certain natural grace together with a nobility that I don't know how to define....""[2] 
At year's end, Degas stopped work on the double portrait of his young cousins in order to begin a larger painting; it is unclear whether he was undertaking The Bellelli Family itself, or making preparatory sketches.[4]

The preparatory works include portrait studies and compositional details in pencil, pastel, and oil. One drawing indicates Degas' initial intention to have Gennaro Bellelli seated at the end of the table,[8] and an oil sketch placed him standing behind his daughters;[1] finally, Degas painted him in the armchair.

In late March 1859, Degas left Florence to return to Paris. Other than the conclusion that Degas worked on the picture ""for several years"",[10] there is no documentation to confirm the actual time or place at which the picture was painted; a likely scenario is that Degas brought to France numerous sketches and studies and painted the picture in a studio procured for this purpose in Paris.[1] Supporting this conclusion is the observation that the Bellelli's apartment was too small to host such a large work, and there were no studio facilities.[1] In March 1860, Degas returned to Italy, in part to conduct family business, and in April he again visited the Bellellis and made several drawings of his uncle; at some point he also executed a pastel which, but for some differences in details and a greater elaboration of the interior in the final painting, is close to the ultimate composition.[11]

There is a family account, once accepted but more recently deemed unlikely, that offers a different version: a Neapolitan lawyer who married one of Degas' grandnieces claimed that the painting was completed in Italy, and brought back to France only some forty to fifty years later, but this is contradicted by evidence that the painting was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1867.[4]

The work of many artists provided inspiration: at this time Degas included in his correspondence mention of Anthony van Dyck, Giorgione, and Botticelli, among others.[4] Other prototypes whose influence have been cited, particularly in terms of composition, include 17th-century Dutch genre and portrait painting,[12] the portrait studies of Ingres,[13] Velázquez's Las Meninas,[5] the portraits of Hans Holbein, the Family of Charles IV by Francisco Goya, Gustave Courbet's After Dinner at Ornans, and a lithograph by Honoré Daumier entitled A Man of Property.[14] As in Las Meninas, a picture, mirror, and doorway are used to expand the space of the interior.[5] Any and all historical models were synthesized into a composition that was ""unique in the painter's oeuvre and unique among the works of his contemporaries.""[14] Taking Degas' family and their living environment as its subject, the painting represented Degas' first attempt ""to characterize a room in relation to the personalities and interests of the individuals who inhabit it.""[15]

Viewed alongside the work of Degas' contemporaries, the painting's uniqueness was due in large part to the composition, which presents a family portrait painted on the grand scale of a historical drama,[14] and whose content has been interpreted as psychologically penetrating, with the placement of the figures suggestive of the parents' alienation from one another, and of the divided loyalties of their children.[16] Laura Bellelli stands as if for an official portrait, her expression indicative of her unhappiness, one hand resting protectively on Giovanna's shoulder, the other balancing her pregnant body;[9] Giulia, in the center of the painting and seated in a small chair, displays youthful restlessness as she faces, arms akimbo, in the direction of her father, and is the compositional link between her estranged parents.[14] Gennaro appears indifferent, turned toward but seated apart from his family, his face mostly in shadow. The commanding figure of Laura is placed against a flat wall and a crisp picture frame, while Gennaro's more recessive figure is framed by a mantelpiece, bric-a-brac, and a reflective mirror. The clarity of the former's surroundings and the ambiguity of the latter's have been interpreted as expressive of their emotional distance.[17] Telling, also, is the physical distance between them, as well as the difference in their postures.[18] Their opposition has been seen as a ""breaking of the frame"": ""it is as if [Gennaro] were morosely watching his family as they pose for his painter nephew"".[19] The family dog glimpsed at the lower right corner is, according to Arthur Danto, sensibly ""sneaking out of the picture before all hell breaks loose"".[20]  One is reminded of Laura Bellelli's note to Degas after he had returned to Paris: ""You must be very happy to be with your family again, instead of being in the presence of a sad face like mine and a disagreeable one like my husband's.""[21]

The drawing hung on the wall behind them is a portrait of the recently deceased Hilaire Degas, and was presumably a study for the portraits Degas made of his grandfather, drawn in the style of the Clouets.[22] By placing it directly behind his aunt's head, Degas was connecting the generations of his family, and following a convention of portraiture used since the Renaissance, that of including ancestral effigies.[22] By its very placement Degas was implicitly affirming his own presence and identifying with Laura, with whom, as their correspondence attests, he was unusually close.[21]

The unease of The Bellelli Family was not an anomaly, nor were such tensions revealed solely through the study of portraiture; in fact, alienation between the sexes was a recurring condition in Degas' work of the 1860s. Sulking and Interior Scene (The Rape) are both works of ambiguous content set in contemporary Paris, and The Young Spartan Girls Provoking the Boys and The Misfortunes of the City of Orleans occur in the ancient and medieval eras, yet in each ""the element of hostility between the sexes is apparent"",[18] and in the latter the hostility has turned deadly. The Bellelli Family is notable for introducing psychological conflict in a painting that documents his own family. Given his usual discretion, it is reasonable to assume that such expressions were the product of Degas' unconscious mind.[23][24]

The painting was almost certainly conceived as an exhibition piece, for it is doubtful that Degas would have painted something so ambitious in scale for purely private satisfaction.[10] In April 1859 Degas wrote his father asking him to look for a studio in Paris so that he could work on an unspecified project; probably The Bellelli Family was the work he had in mind, and it is believed that the painting was eventually exhibited in the Salon of 1867.[10] Although reviews made no mention of the picture, that this is the painting which Degas exhibited under the title of Family Portrait is supported by several pieces of evidence: a critic who later visited Degas in his studio referred to ""the admirable Family Portrait of 1867""; in 1881 the painter Jean-Jacques Henner discussed Degas' withdrawal from the Salons because his work was badly hung and ignored as a result, adding ""The portrait of his brother-in-law (I believe) and his family is a great work""; and the fact that Degas requested permission at the last minute to retouch his submissions to the 1867 Salon, and that the hasty reworking would account for the picture's later crackling and blackish streaks.[25]

The Bellelli Family remained with Degas until his last move in 1913, at which time he left it with his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel.[26]  The painting was not seen again publicly until after Degas's death, when it was put up for sale in 1918 as part of the painter's estate.[27] Its unexpected appearance created a sensation,[26] and The Bellelli Family was immediately purchased by the Musée du Luxembourg for 400,000 francs.[14]

In 1947 the painting was exhibited in the Musée d'Impressionisme (Jeu-de-Paumes), and subsequently moved to the Musée d'Orsay.[2]

At the time of its sale in 1918, the painting was in poor condition.[26] In addition to the black streaks and crackling, it had tears and was dust-covered, and may have been kept by Degas for many years rolled-up in the corner of his successive studios.[10] At some point, possibly in the 1890s, Degas restored the painting, sewing up tears, applying gesso to them,  repainting Laura Bellelli's face, and retouching those of his uncle and cousins.[1] However, prior to the painting's sale a restorer apparently misinterpreted these repairs and scraped them off, re-injuring the portraits of Gennaro and Giulia.[1] The painting was subsequently restored in the 1980s.[4]

When exhibited at the sale of Degas' atelier in 1918, the picture elicited some confusion from critics; one called it ""as dull as a Flemish interior, although the dry technique is distinctive.""[14] Most of the reviews were positive, and with the country at war, The Bellelli Family was seen as possessing a distinctly French character, a ""modern primitive"" that bore comparison to the Avignon Pieta.[14] Since then, biographers of Degas have acknowledged it as the masterpiece of his youth.[26][28]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24011,"The portrait of Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière was painted in 1806[1] by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and today hangs in the Louvre.

It is the third of three portraits of the Rivière family the artist painted that year. Caroline's father, Philibert Rivière, was a successful court official under Napoleon's empire, and sought to commemorate himself, his wife and daughter through a commission with the then young and rising artist—Ingrres's portraits of Philibert and his wife are also still extant.[2] Although Ingres favoured subject matter drawn from history or Greek legend, at this early stage in his career he earned his living mainly through commissions from wealthy patrons.[1]

The family lived outside Paris, at St. Germain-en-Laye, and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière would have been between 13 and 15 at the time she was portrayed; Ingres described her as the ""ravishing daughter"".[3]

Rivière's portrait describes slightly built and youthful femininity and hints at a hesitant openness. The painting is rendered in bright hues and set against a serene white-blue early spring landscape, the freshness of which was intended to reflect the youth of the sitter. The background is not deeply portrayed; the perspective is shallow and rises—according to the art historian Robert Rosenblum—in ""flattened horizontal tiers against which the figure seems crisply silhouetted as if in low relief.""[3]

Typical of contemporary portraits by Ingres, Caroline lacks anatomical accuracy. Her neck is overly elongated, and the bridge of her nose extends too far.[1] Rivière is portrayed with a stiffness and awkwardness typical of her age, and shown in a manner which was intended to emphasise a sense of the nascent purity and simplicity of her youth. Yet the painting is generally seen in the light of pathos and tragedy, as the sitter died within a year of the work being completed.[1][4]

It was, along with Ingres's two other portrayals of the family, exhibited in the 1806 Salon, but was poorly received for its perceived ""Gothicness"" (due to its precision of line and enamel finish) and its similarity to Jan van Eyck and other artists of Early Netherlandish painting (in French ""Les Primitifs Flamands"") who at the time were only just being rediscovered.[1] Further, the manner in which the whiteness of the sitter's dress contrasts with the curve of her boa offended some viewers.[5] Today the painting is typically seen as a peak in Ingres's artistic career,[6] and in this work Ingres introduces an emotional link between figurative and landscape art, and the watery scape behind the sitter evokes rhythms with many of the visual themes presented in the rich imagery of the foreground.[3]

In 2003, the art critic Jonathan Jones remarked of the painting,

The sexuality Ingres usually reserved for harem fantasies slips over into the real and respectable world in this charged portrait. His obviously intense visual relationship with his subject and his contentment to look, with a clinical waxy fetishism, at Mademoiselle Rivière's full lips, bared neck, long gloves and spectacularly serpentine boa, lend this picture drama.""[5]
Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière was bequeathed to the Louvre in 1870 by Caroline Rivière's sister-in-law.[7]

It was exhibited in Paris in 1860, helping the frères Goncourt rescue Fragonard from the obscurity into which he had fallen after the French Revolution, albeit only as a frivolous painter – his skill as a history painter was not recognised until the 20th century.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17492521,"Boabdil's Farewell to Granada (French: L'Adieu du roi Boabdil à Grenade) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Alfred Dehodencq. It was first exhibited at the Salon of 1869 and is currently in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay.[1][2]

There are numerous drawn studies and two painted sketches by Dehodencq that show little variation with the finished work. One of these is at the Arnoldi-Livie Gallery in Munich and the other is in the Snite Museum of Art at the  University of Notre Dame.[2][3] The Louvre also has a sketch for a figure who may be Boabdil.[4]

The painting depicts an episode in the life of the last Emir of Granada, Mohammed XII, known as Boabdil. Sent into exile after Granada fell in 1492, he turned back for one last look at his city, and wept.[5] The high-angled perspective of the viewer and Boabdil's backward turn, against the forward movement of his horse and groom, make the composition particularly lively and moving.[1]

Paul Armand Silvestre noted that the style of the painting owed much to Eugène Delacroix, but was unlikely to please his supporters.[6] Théophile Thoré-Bürger agreed that Denhodencq imitated Delacroix, and described the painting as ""a composition without character, poorly drawn and heavily painted.[7] Maurice Cristal felt that the composition was not above reproach, but the artist's the use of colour and light was remarkable, producing a canvas that radiated life.[8]

Gabriel Jean Edmond Séailles was more generous in his judgement, praising the grandeur of its melancholy beauty. As he saw it, Denhodencq's mastery ensured that the bitter sadness of Boabdil transcended his person and situation and became part of an impersonal and universal sadness at the human condition. He also detailed how the concept of the painting evolved through the artist's sketches. The first version showed Granada far off in the distance, and close to Boabdil a group of Arab women including his mother, who is said to have jeered at him ""weep, weep like a woman for the city you could not defend like a man."" This early version was a narrative painting, full of corroborative detail about the famous anecdote. However the final version strips out these details, leaving nothing but Boabdil, his horse and groom, and nothing to distract the viewer from the intensity of his feeling. This radical simplicity makes his suffering universal.[9]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1608116,"The Maestà is a painting by the Italian artist Cimabue, executed around 1280 and housed in the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

It was acquired by the Louvre in 1813 as part of the Napoleonic spoliation of artworks in Italy, together with Giotto's Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, also from the church of San Francesco in Pisa.

The work is considered to be from around 1280, thus preceding the Santa Trinita Maestà. It is also stylistically earlier to that work, being painted without pseudo-perspective, and having the angels around the Virgin simply placed one above the other, rather than being spatially arranged. The throne is similar to the Maestà painted by Cimabue in the Basilica of San Francesco di Assisi (1288–1292).

This work established a new canon for the Madonna with Child theme, which was subsequently used by other painters, such as Duccio di Buoninsegna in his Rucellai Maestà.

Born in Paris, she was the daughter of Augustin-Alexandre d'Herbez, called Saint-Aubin, tenor de l'Opéra de Paris and Jeanne-Charlotte Schroeder, Madame Saint-Aubin, soprano at the Comédie-Italienne and the Opéra-Comique. She was the elder sister of Alexandrine Saint-Aubin (1793–1867).

She took lessons for three years from the composer Angelo Tarchi[1] and enters the Conservatoire de Paris to perfect his skills in the class of Pierre-Jean Garat[2] She left to debut at the Opéra Comique 24 May 1804[3] in Le Concert interrompu, by Berton, where she gets a success. She plays with her mother in Michel-Ange, by Nicolas Isouard, then shows herself in Montano et Stéphanie, by Berton. After four or five months of stay at the Opéra-Comique, she suddenly leaves this theater[4][3] only to return after an absence of about four years. She returned to the Conservatoire. On 24 September 1804, she married the violinist Marcel Duret.[5]

On 4 and 7 April 1808, she played Montano and Stéphanie, on 9 April Le Concert interrompu, and continued with a series of performances of these two works, after which she created the role of Florina in Nicolo's Cimarosa, then took on the role of Zémire in Zémire et Azor.

She was accepted as a member of the Society in 1811. Isouard wrote especially for her the leading roles in Lully et Quinault, Le Billet de loterie, Jeannot et Colin, and Le Magicien sans magie.[6] She was the rival of Antoinette Lemonnier, due to the fact that Boieldieu wrote mainly for Madame Lemonnier, Isouard mainly for her.[7]

For health reasons, she was forced to retire in 1820.[8]

Duret-Saint-Aubin died in the 9th arrondissement of Paris aged 77, and was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.[9]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17491050,"Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable is an 1860 Orientalist painting by Eugène Delacroix, signed and dated by the artist and now in the musée d'Orsay.[1]

The artist assisted in a stallion-fight during his time in Morocco, which left a deep impression and was mentioned in a letter to his friends on 8 February 1832[2] He produced a sketch of it and noted that ""the grey horse passed his head under the neck of the other [horse]"".[2] In his diary entry for 19 June 1854 Delacroix mentioned this subject as one of several Morocco-themed works he was then working on, but even so he only seems to have begun Arab Horses around two years later in 1856. He completed it on 14 June 1860,[3] putting thirty years between the stallion-fight and the work's completion. He produced the work for Estienne, the same art dealer as Horses Leaving the Sea, and so the two works are usually considered as a pair.[2]

The work was sold in Paris on 12 February 1872 and the following year John Saulnier acquired it in Bordeaux. It was next recorded as being owned by Charles Hayem in 1885, then by Isaac de Camondo.[3] It was donated to the Louvre in 1908,[4] exhibiting it two years later [5] It was moved to its present home in 1986.[1]

Judith Cladel (Rodin's friend and biographer) states that it arose from his study of caryatids. The model was probably the Italian Adèle Abruzzesi,[1][2] one of Rodin's favourite models. The sculpture was only completed in 1889 by the addition of the legs and left arm, for use in the top left-hand corner of The Gates of Hell. It does not appear in William Elborne's 1887 photographs of The Gates and so Rodin probably added it later. He also used the same torso, with a head added, for the female figures in Eternal Springtime and Illusions Received by the Earth.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q597114,"Death of the Virgin (1606) is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio depicting the death of the Virgin Mary. It is part of the permanent collection of the Musée du Louvre, in Paris.[4]

When he painted The Death of the Virgin (c. 1601–06), Caravaggio had been working in Rome for fifteen years.[5] The painting was commissioned by Laerzio Cherubini, a papal lawyer, for his chapel in the Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala in Trastevere, Rome; the painting could not have been finished before 1605–06.[5]  The depiction of the Death of the Virgin caused a contemporary stir, and was rejected as unfit by the parish.

Giulio Mancini thought Caravaggio modelled a prostitute, possibly his mistress, as the Virgin.[a] Giovanni Baglione[b] and Gian Pietro Bellori[c] attributed the rejection to the appearance of the Virgin. The breach of decorum led to a rejection of the painting by the fathers of Santa Maria della Scala and its replacement by a picture by Carlo Saraceni, a close follower of Caravaggio.[9]

Upon the recommendation by Peter Paul Rubens, who praised it as one of Caravaggio's best works, the painting was bought by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. Giovanni Magni, the duke's ambassador, briefly exhibited the painting in his house on the Via del Corso, between 1 and 7 April 1607.[10] Copying was absolutely forbidden.[11]

The duke's collection was sold to Charles I of England in 1627.  After his execution the English Commonwealth put his collection up for sale in 1649, and the painting was bought by Everhard Jabach, who in 1671 sold it to Louis XIV for the French Royal Collection, which after the French Revolution became the property of the state.[6] Today it hangs in the Louvre. Prior to leaving Rome, it was shown at the Academy of Painters for under two weeks. However, Caravaggio had fled Rome by then, never to publicly return. (During one of his frequent brawls in Rome, the mercurial and impulsive Caravaggio had killed a man, Ranuccio Tomassoni, in a sword fight following a tennis game.)

The painting recalls Caravaggio's Entombment in the Vatican in scope, sobriety, and the photographic naturalism. The figures are nearly life-sized. Mary lies reclined, clad in a simple red dress. The lolling head, the hanging arm, the swollen, spread feet depict a raw and realistic view of the Virgin's mortal remains. Caravaggio completely abandons the iconography traditionally used to indicate the holiness of the Virgin. In this cast-off body, nothing of the respectful representation found in devotional paintings remains.[5]

The composition is arranged around the Virgin, the painting's central theme. Surrounding the Virgin are overcome Mary Magdalene and apostles. Others shuffle in behind them. The compact mass of the assemblage and the posturing of the figures guide the viewer's eye toward the abandoned body. He expresses the greater grief of the former not by a more emotive face, but by hiding their faces. Caravaggio, master of stark and dark canvases, is not interested in a mannerist exercise that captures a range of emotions. In some ways this is a silent grief, this is no wake for wailers. The sobbing occurs in faceless emotional silence. The holiness of the Virgin is discerned by her thread-like halo. Suppressing all anecdotal detail, Caravaggio invests this subdued scene with extraordinary monumentality through the sole presence of these figures and the intensity of their emotions. The theatrical drape of blood-red cloth looms in the upper portion of the canvas; a common motif in deposition painting, here used to heighten the scene's dramatic effect.[5]

The painter makes use of the nuances of light and shadow to model the volumes of the objects, figures, and clothing. But above all he accentuates, through this process, the physical presence of the Virgin, struck by a dazzling light. The artist creates the illusion of depth through a series of lighter areas: from the back of Mary Magdalene's neck in the foreground, the eye penetrates further into the painting, passing from Mary's face to the hands and heads of the apostles.[5]

This painting was completed at a time when the dogma of the Assumption of Mary was not yet formally enunciated ex cathedra by the pope, but had been gaining ground for some centuries. Pope Pius XII, in his Apostolic constitution, Munificentissimus Deus (1950), which dogmatically defined the Assumption, left open the question of whether or not Mary actually underwent death in connection with her departure, but alludes to the fact of her death at least five times. The New Testament does not mention the matter at all.  How she passed from this world is and was therefore not a matter of Catholic dogma, although by the 17th century, the conventional belief among Catholics was that she was assumed alive, as shown in the great majority of contemporary paintings of the subject.  By then most believed that she felt no pain or disease, and that she was assumed in healthy if aged body and soul prior to ""death"". However, during a General Audience on 25 June 1997, Pope John Paul II affirmed that Mary did indeed experience natural death prior to her assumption into Heaven.[13]

Caravaggio's painting is the last major Catholic work of art in which Mary is clearly dead.  Caravaggio does not depict an assumption but her death.  The figure, like that in nearly all Renaissance and Baroque Assumptions, looks much younger than a woman some 50 or more years old;[d] medieval depictions of the death were often more realistic in this respect.

This painting illustrates the iconographic and formal revolution that Caravaggio instigated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Distancing himself from the precious, affected mannerist vogue, the artist inaugurated a frank, robust, energetic style. He took on the task of translating people's reality and emotions without worrying about the conventions of representations of the sacred. His impact on the evolution of pictorial conceptions in the 17th century was considerable.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4023318,"Yvonne and Christine Lerolle at the Piano (Yvonne et Christine Lerolle au piano) is an 1897 oil painting (73 x 92 cm) by the French painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, kept at the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris.

Renoir achieved great success with his portraits, becoming the favourite painter for the French bourgeoisie. This meant that the Parisian bourgeoisie accepted impressionist painters and rejected the works of academic masters. The Lerolle family was a great protector of the new creators, especially French Impressionist artist Edgar Degas (1834–1917).

Yvonne dresses in white and strives to play a piece on the piano while her sister Christine contemplates the score in an accomplice way. Although Renoir does not renounce capturing natural light and colour, he is particularly interested in the modelling and drawing of the figures, wrapped in an atmosphere that does not manage to dilute the contours like Claude Monet (1840–1926), the French painter and founder of Impressionism. 

The expressiveness of the two models is another point of reference in the work, although in recent works Renoir does not load the inks on the personality of his models as in his early works (see Léonard Renoir or Victor Chocquet). In this way, Renoir presents himself as a painter who gives joy and a certain romanticism to his compositions, achieving an important success before the public, as proof that this work was the first acquired by the French State.

Like Girls at the Piano (1892) before it, Yvonne and Christine Lerolle at the Piano is also significant on the formal level since the pictorial material here is no longer treated with the severely linear style of the previous decade, but with a renewed freshness and a recovery of the chromatic harmonies typical of the impressionist phase of the painter. An optimistic theme, much loved by bourgeois collectors, is portrayed: that of girls in a domestic atmosphere, playing games, reading or, as in this case, practicing music. 

Renoir describes with great precision various details of the domestic environment in which the girls find themselves, focusing mainly on the two paintings hanging on the wall, in this case Before the Race and A Group of Dancers, both by Degas. The dominant colour is the white of the girl's dress in the foreground, which, however, does not resolve itself in the soft luminosity that flooded Girls at the Piano, creating an all in all cold atmosphere.[1]

Renoir addresses several iconographic models in this canvas. Transparent is the reference to contemporary paintings by French Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot (1841–1895), who loved to paint domestic scenes of this type: in the nineteenth century, in fact, the home assumed new meanings, and became a place to escape from the alienating and depersonalizing frenzy of modern civilization. The scene as a whole is also linked to the genre scenes of 17th century Dutch painters, especially Dutch Baroque Period painter Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675), the author of paintings that stand out for their tame, pearly quietness.[1]

The painting, completed in 1897, was purchased by Henry Roujon during the exhibition dedicated to the painter. At the instigation of Stéphane Mallarmé, Roujon intended to create a collection of living artists, of contemporary art, to be permanently exhibited at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris: this is a detail that shows how, at the end of the 19th century, Renoir had by then become one of the most famous French artists. Today the painting is on display at the Musée de l'Orangerie.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3937775,"Equestrian Portrait of Francisco de Moncada is a 1634 oil on canvas painting by Antony van Dyck, one of his most famous portraits,[1] now INV 1240 in Room 850 (d) of the Louvre Museum, which acquired it from the Palazzo Braschi in Rome in 1798.[2][3]

It shows Francisco de Moncada, who for one year was governor of the Spanish Netherlands.[4] It was one of a pair of portraits of Moncada simultaneously commissioned in 1634, just after his return to his native Flanders after a stay in London - the other is in the seated Portrait of Francisco de Moncada (Kunsthistorisches Museum).[5] He probably copied the pose from a drawing of a horse-rider seen face on by his former master Peter Paul Rubens,[6] whilst Charles Coypel in turn produced a copy of the work.[7][8]

The two best-known versions of the portrait are in Spain: one in the Museu de Belles Arts in Valencia and the other in the collection of the Duke of Alba. The first, made by Van Dyck himself, was acquired by Manuel Montesinos y Molina and remained in his family until 1941 when it was donated to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos to be exhibited in the Valencian art gallery. The second, a copy of the Van Dyck, would have been commissioned by the mother of the Marchioness of Carpio, Catalina Fernández de Córdoba, and, after the extinction of the house of Haro, it passed with the titles and other properties to the Dukes of Alba.

Other copies are those made by Géricault and Watteau that are in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and the Lousada collection, respectively.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1923320,"Portrait of Madeleine, formerly known as Portrait of a Black Woman (French: Portrait d'une femme noire or Portrait d'une negresse), is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Marie-Guillemine Benoist.  It was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1800, was acquired by Louis XVIII for the French state in 1818, and remains in the collection of the Louvre.

The half-length portrait measures 81 cm × 65 cm (32 in × 26 in). It depicts a young black woman, sitting in a gilt armchair mostly covered with a blue cloth, in front of a plain light background. She is seated in a three-quarter position towards her left, but her head turns to look directly at the viewer with a self-assured expression. She is wearing a white cloth tied as a headdress, and a white dress tied with a red cord. The loose end of the headcloth hangs down on the left side of her face, but her right ear is visible with a hoop hearing. Her right arm rests in her lap; her left arm is holding up the dress, but it has slipped down to reveal her right breast. Her legs fall outside the frame. The realistic dark skin tones – long considered a challenging topic for European artists – shows Benoit's artistic skill. It is signed by the subject's right hand with the artist's maiden name and married names: ""Laville Leroulx / f. Benoist"" (""f"" for ""femme"", or ""wife of"").

The composition has similarities to Benoist's 1802 portrait of Madame Philippe Panon Desbassayns de Richemont and her son Eugène, now held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The painting was first exhibited at the 1800 Paris Salon as Portrait d'une négresse. Along with three other works by Benoist, the painting was acquired by Louis XVIII for France in 1818 for a total price of 11,000 francs. Initially held at the Luxembourg Palace, it has been in the collection at the Louvre for many years.

The painting was renamed Portrait de Madeleine after recent scholarship led to the identification of the subject in 2019 as a woman named Madeleine [fr] who came to France from Guadeloupe after slavery was abolished in France and its colonies in 1794, and who worked as a servant for Benoist's in-laws, the Benoist-Cavays.

The subject – a woman of colour – was unusual at the time: the only other portrait of a person of colour at the Paris Salon in this period was Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson's 1797 portrait of Jean-Baptiste Belley.

Its enigmatic presentation and apparent internal contradictions have prompted much speculation about the artist's motivation and intentions, with recent interpretations focussing on ideas of slavery, race, gender, class, and their interactions.

Madeline was a servant, yet is depicted in a wealthy milieu, wearing jewellery and sitting on an expensive chair. Most paintings of the period that include black women show them as servants to a white woman; while Madeline sits alone, she is working as a model to the unseen Benoist. The simple white clothes have a neoclassical air, similar to other contemporary portraits such as Jacques-Louis David’s 1799 portrait of Henriette de Verninac. The bared breast would be unusual for a portrait painting, and suggests an allegory or mythological subject, or possibly alludes to the slave trade. The colours – red, white, blue – parallel the colours of the French revolutionary tricolour adopted in 1789, and may suggest an allusion to Marianne, a female personification of liberty and of France itself.  

Painted in the brief period between the abolition of slavery in 1794 and the reinstatement of slavery in French colonies by Napoleon in 1802, the work has been taken as a symbol of women's emancipation and black people's rights.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q97959646,"The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, also called The Rest on the Return from the Flight into Egypt is a circa 1530 oil painting by the Venetian Renaissance painter Paris Bordone. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 176.[2]

The work was painted around 1530 as an altarpiece for the Benedictine church Santa Maria della Misericordia of Noale (today the parish church Chiesa dell'Assunta). It was bought in London in 1890 by Wilhelm von Bode, from the collection of Charles Fairfax Murray. The painting was restaured in 1965.[1]

The painting depicts a sleeping Saint Joseph, the babies Jesus and John the Baptist playing with a lamb, and Mary, being approached from the right by an older woman with distinctly ""gypsy"" features. Some art historians have identified her as Saint Elisabeth, which would account for the presence of John the Baptist and the pictured moment being on the return from Egypt instead of on the way there. It does not, however, explain why Mary would, in that case, have the bewildered gaze and gesture with which Bordone represented her, nor what the solemn and distant attitude of ""Elisabeth"" would stand for.Another theory states that this woman is a gypsy fortune-teller, announcing the future fate of both boys. Gypsies (Zingari) were a recurring subject in Venetian painting, influenced by Giorgione's famous The Tempest. A 2015 interpretation of the painting claims that it is inspired by the Syriac Infancy Gospel, in which Mary, on her way to Egypt, would frequently be approached by sick people in search of a miraculous healing, which she would always grant them. In that case, the ""Gypsy"" would be an old Egyptian showing facial symptoms of the plague, a disease of which Paris Bordone was afraid as well.[2][1]

Liberty Leading the People (French: La Liberté guidant le peuple [la libɛʁte ɡidɑ̃ lə pœpl]) is a painting by Eugène Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830, which toppled King Charles X. A woman of the people with a Phrygian cap personifying the concept of Liberty leads a varied group of people forward over a barricade and the bodies of the fallen, holding the flag of the French Revolution – the tricolour, which again became France's national flag after these events – in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The figure of Liberty is also viewed as a symbol of France and the French Republic known as Marianne. The painting is sometimes wrongly thought to depict the French Revolution of 1789.

Liberty Leading the People is exhibited in the Louvre in Paris.

By the time Delacroix painted Liberty Leading the People, he was already the acknowledged leader of the Romantic school in French painting.[2] Delacroix, who was born as the Age of Enlightenment was giving way to the ideas and style of romanticism, rejected the emphasis on precise drawing that characterised the academic art of his time, and instead gave a new prominence to freely brushed colour.

Delacroix painted his work in the autumn of 1830. In a letter to his brother dated 21 October, he wrote: ""My bad mood is vanishing thanks to hard work. I've embarked on a modern subject—a barricade. And if I haven't fought for my country at least I'll paint for her."" The painting was first exhibited at the official Salon of 1831.

Delacroix depicted Liberty as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people. The mound of corpses and wreckage acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. According to Marcus Rediker[3] she might have been inspired by a Dutch portrait of a fighting Anne Bonny. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution, of 1789. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the Romantic era.[4]

The fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, a student from the prestigious École Polytechnique wearing the traditional bicorne, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols. What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute tricolore can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of Notre-Dame.[5]

The identity of the man in the top hat has been widely debated. The suggestion that it was a self-portrait by Delacroix has been discounted by modern art historians.[6] In the late 19th century, it was suggested the model was the theatre director Étienne Arago; others have suggested the future curator of the Louvre, Frédéric Villot; but there is no firm consensus on this point.[7]

Several of the figures are probably borrowed from a print by popular artist Nicolas Charlet, a prolific illustrator who Delacroix believed captured, more than anyone else, the peculiar energy of the Parisians.[8]

The French government bought the painting in 1831 for 3,000 francs with the intention of displaying it in the throne room of the Palais du Luxembourg as a reminder to the ""citizen-king"" Louis-Philippe of the July Revolution, through which he had come to power. This plan did not come to fruition and the canvas hung in the palace's museum gallery for a few months, before being removed due to its inflammatory political message. After the June Rebellion of 1832, it was returned to the artist. According to Albert Boime,

Champfleury wrote in August 1848 that it had been ""hidden in an attic for being too revolutionary."" Although Louis-Philippe's Ministry of the Interior initially acquired it as a gesture to the Left, after the uprising at the funeral of Lamarque in June 1832 it was never again openly displayed for fear of setting a bad example.[9]
 Delacroix was permitted to send the painting to his aunt Félicité for safekeeping. After the Second Republic was established following the revolution of 1848 it was exhibited briefly in that year, and then during the Second Empire in the Salon of 1855. The recently established Third Republic finally acquired the painting in 1874 for the collection of the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

In 1974–75, the painting was the featured work in an exhibition organized by the French government, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Detroit Institute of Arts as a Bicentennial gift to the people of the United States. The exhibition, entitled French Painting 1774–1830: The Age of Revolution, marked a rare display of the Delacroix painting, and many of the other 148 works, outside France.[10]  The exhibition was first shown at the Grand Palais from 16 November 1974 to 3 February 1975. It moved to Detroit from 5 March to 4 May 1975, then New York from 12 June to 7 September 1975.[11]

In 1999, it was flown on board an Airbus Beluga from Paris to Tokyo via Bahrain and Calcutta in about 20 hours. The large canvas, measuring 2.99 metres (9.8 feet) high by 3.62 metres (11.9 feet) long, was too large to fit into a Boeing 747. It was transported in the vertical position inside a special pressurised container provided with isothermal protection and an anti-vibration device.[12]

In 2012, it was moved to the new Louvre-Lens museum in Lens, Pas-de-Calais, as the starring work in the first tranche of paintings from the Louvre's collection to be installed.[13] On 7 February 2013, the painting was vandalized by a visitor in Lens. An unidentified 28-year-old woman allegedly wrote an inscription (""AE911"") on the painting.[14][15] The woman was immediately arrested by a security guard and a visitor. A short time after the incident, the management of the Louvre and its Pas-de-Calais branch published a press release indicating that ""at first glance, the inscription is superficial and should be easily removed"".[16][17] Louvre officials announced the next day that the writing had been removed in less than two hours by a restorer without damaging the original paint, and the piece returned to display that morning.[15]

Although Delacroix was not the first artist to depict Liberty in a Phrygian cap, his painting may be the best known early version of the figure commonly known as Marianne, a symbol of the French Republic and of France in general.[18]

The painting may have influenced Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables. In particular, the character of Gavroche is widely believed to have been inspired by the figure of the pistols-wielding boy running over the barricade.[19][20][21][22] The novel describes the events of the June Rebellion two years after the revolution celebrated in the painting, the same rebellion that led to its being removed from public view.

The painting inspired Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's Liberty Enlightening the World, known as the Statue of Liberty in New York City, which was given to the United States as a gift from the French a half-century after Liberty Leading the People was painted.[8] The statue, which holds a torch in its hand, takes a more stable, immovable stance than that of the woman in the painting. An engraved version of part of the painting, along with a depiction of Delacroix, was featured on the 100 franc note from 1978 to 1995.

The painting has had an influence on classical music. George Antheil titled his Symphony No. 6 After Delacroix, and stated that the work was inspired by Liberty Leading the People.[23]  The imagery was adapted by Robert Ballagh to commemorate Ireland's independence struggle on an Irish postage stamp in 1979, the centenary of the birth of Pádraig Pearse,[24] and the painting was used for the band Coldplay's 2008 album cover Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, with the words Viva La Vida written in white.[25] Rigoberta Bandini references the painting in the chorus of her 2021 song Ay mamá.[26] The cover of the 2010 book Enough is Enough: How to Build a New Republic by Fintan O'Toole references the painting, but with Kathleen Ni Houlihan holding the Irish tricolour in Dublin while the leaders of the three main political parties at the time (Brian Cowen, Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore) lie on the ground.[27]

During the 20 October 2011 episode of the BBC Radio 4 series In Our Time, host Melvyn Bragg led a panel discussion of the painting.[28]

Liberty Leading the People made an appearance in the 11th episode (""EDGELORD - Revolution of the 14-Year-Olds"") of the Netflix animation series Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045.

The painting was featured in Vincenzo, a 2021 South Korean TV series starring Song Joong-ki in episode 7. The series is also available on Netflix.

A photograph of Aed Abu Amro taken during the 2018–2019 Gaza border protests by Mustafa Hassona on 22 October 2018, was considered by some a personification of the Liberty Leading the People.[29]

Libery Leading the People makes a prominent appearance in the 2023 film John Wick Chapter 4, starring Keanu Reeves. Near the end of the second act, main antagonist,  Marquis Vincent de Garmont (Bill Skarsgård) is seen standing before Liberty Leading the People inside the Louvre Museum, which was famously closed to the public for the filming of the scenes.[30]

Liberty Leading the People is considered a republican and anti-monarchist symbol, and as such was sometimes criticized by royalists and monarchists.[31][32]

It shows the saint in a contraposto pose drawn from the Doryphoros of Polykleitos, echoed in a later autograph copy now in São Paulo. The symmetrical composition draws on Perugino's earlier works - he first used the motif in St Sebastian between St Roch and St Peter, a fresco painted in Cerqueto near Perugia. He stands on a terrace beneath a monumental arch with grotesque-decorated pilasters and a balustrade. On the base of the platform is the Latin inscription ""SAGITTAE. TUAE.INFIXAE. SUNT.

Woman Bitten by a Serpent is an 1847 marble sculpture by Auguste Clésinger (1814–1883), now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.

It was commissioned by the industrialist Alfred Mosselman and first exhibited in the Paris Salon in 1847, where it and Thomas Couture's The Romans in their Decadence were the most commented-upon works.[1] Clésinger had modelled his work on a life-cast of Mossellman's mistress, the demi-mondaine Apollonie Sabatier (1822–1890), later Charles Baudelaire's muse. The direct use of a life cast as the basis for a sculpture was highly controversial in the 19th century, particularly in its realism, such as the reproduction of the model's cellulite.  Clésinger's friend Théophile Gautier orchestrated a response to the art critics' scandalised reviews, ensuring the sculpture's great success.[1]

At the end of 1847 Clésinger also produced a Reclining Bacchante, slightly larger than Woman so as to confute criticisms of his technical skills with marble. This was exhibited in room 4 of the Petit Palais in the 1848 Salon – Théophile Gautier wrote that it showed ""pure orgiastic delirium, the disheveled Maenad tumbled at the feet of Bacchus, father of liberty and joy ... A powerful spasm of happiness contracts and raises the young woman's opulent bosom and in fact makes the sparkling breasts spring up."". He concluded by calling the work ""one of the most beautiful pieces of modern sculpture"".[2] It was a major inspiration for the American painter Kehinde Wiley's 2008 Woman bitten by a serpent.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3201862,"Cupid Disarmed (L'Amour désarmé) is a c. 1715 oil-on-canvas painting, usually but not definitively attributed to Antoine Watteau. It is one of eight paintings kept by Watteau's friend and protector Jean de Jullienne until the latter's death in 1766. Benoît Audran engraved it in 1727 and described and reproduced it in an inventory of the Jullienne collection in 1756. After Jullienne's death the art dealer Boileau bought it for Jean-Baptiste de Montullé, Jullienne's executor.

It was sold again in 1783 and seems to have been sold from the hôtel Bullion to a British collector after the Reign of Terror, before returning to France just before 1848. It then entered the collection of the marquis de Maison, with which it was bought by Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale in 1868, who hung it in the salle de la Tribune in his château de Chantilly. It still forms part of the Musée Condé.

It is one of the rare mythological paintings painted by Watteau, representing Venus grasping Cupid's bow. One hypotheses is that it was painted at the time of the reception of the painter at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. According to Pierre-Jean Mariette, Watteau was inspired by a drawing by Paul Veronese which had belonged to Pierre Crozat then to Mariette himself and which is now kept in the Louvre museum.[1]

By its format and its characters, the painting has also been compared to another painting by Watteau: Autumn, which is also kept at the Louvre.[2]

There are many replicas of it. It is a relatively common theme in academic painting, taken up by François Boucher in 1751.

It is considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, and has been described as ""the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world"". The painting's novel qualities include the subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.

The painting is likely of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that it would not have been started before 1513. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic itself, on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q849063,"The Venus of Brassempouy (French: la Dame de Brassempouy, [la dam də bʁasɛ̃pwi], meaning ""Lady of Brassempouy"", or Dame à la Capuche, ""Lady with the Hood"") is a fragmentary ivory figurine from the Upper Palaeolithic, apparently broken from a larger figure at some time unknown. It was discovered in a cave at Brassempouy, France in 1894.[1] About 25,000 years old, it is one of the earliest known realistic representations of a human face.

Brassempouy is a small village in the département of Landes in southwest France. Two caves near the village, 100 metres from each other, were among the first Paleolithic sites to be explored in France. They are known as the Galerie des Hyènes (Gallery of the Hyenas) and the Grotte du Pape (the ""Grotto of the Pope""). The Venus of Brassempouy was discovered in the Grotto of the Pope in 1894,[2] accompanied by at least eight other human figures. These may be an example of unfinished work, as if the artist or artists carved several figurines at the same time.

P. E. Dubalen first explored the Grotte du Pape during 1881, followed by J. de Laporterie and Édouard Piette (1827–1906) from 1894 onwards. Since archaeological excavation techniques were then only starting to be developed, they paid little attention to the stratigraphy of the site containing the remains. In 1892 the site was pillaged and disturbed almost beyond reconstruction by a field visit of amateurs from the Association française pour l’avancement de la science.[3] Nevertheless, Piette described layers attributed to the late and middle Solutrean period. He termed the bottom levels he reached as éburnéen (pale or white like ivory), in reference to the copious amounts of ivory works which they contained. Modern reanalysis of the site has been performed under the direction of Henri Delporte during 1981–2000.

In 1894, one of those strata, recognized now as Gravettian, yielded several fragments of statuettes, including the ""Lady with the Hood"". Piette considered the figures as closely related to the representations of animals of the Magdalenian period. He developed a hypothetical chronology that was later refuted by Henri Breuil.

The Venus of Brassempouy was carved from mammoth ivory. According to archaeologist Paul Bahn the head is ""unsexed, although it is usually called a 'Venus' or a 'lady'"".[4] The head is 3.65 cm high, 2.2 cm deep and 1.9 cm wide. While forehead, nose and brows are carved in relief, the mouth is absent. A vertical crack on the right side of the face is a consequence of the internal structure of the ivory. On the head is a checkerboard-like pattern formed by two series of shallow incisions at right angles to each other; it has been interpreted as a wig, a hood with geometric decoration,[5] or simply a representation of hair styled in cornrows.[6]

Randall White observed in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory (December 2006), ""The figurines emerged from the ground into a colonial intellectual and socio-political context nearly obsessed with matters of race.""[7] Although the style of representation is essentially realistic, the proportions of the head do not correspond exactly to any known human population of the present or past. White has claimed that, since the mid-twentieth century, concerns of interpretative questions have changed from race to womanhood and fertility.[7]

Although the head was discovered so early that its context could not be studied thoroughly, scholars agree that the Venus of Brassempouy belonged to an Upper Palaeolithic material culture, the Gravettian (29,000–22,000 BP). More precisely, they date the figurine to the Middle Gravettian period, with ""Noailles"" burins circa 26,000 to 24,000 BP.[8] It is more or less contemporary with the other Palaeolithic Venus figurines, such as those of Lespugue, Dolní Věstonice, Willendorf, etc. Nonetheless, it is distinguished among the group by the realistic character of the representation.

Other broadly contemporary representations of female faces include the female face from Dolní Věstonice (c. 26,000 BP), or the Venuses with faces of the Mal'ta Culture (Siberia, 24,000 BP).

The Venus of Brassempouy is preserved in the Musée d'Archéologie Nationale at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris[10] Since ivory is very susceptible to damage from factors such as temperature change, moisture, and light, the figure is not part of the Palaeolithic department, but is exhibited in the Salle Piette of the Museum, opened only by reservation.

At Brassempouy, a variety of objects excavated in the Grotte du Pape are on display at the Maison de la Dame. This exhibition space, devoted primarily to regional archaeology, also displays a fine set of casts of palaeolithic sculptures. These include the nine existing specimens from Brassempouy, but also casts of the well-known figures from Lespugue, Willendorf and Dolní Věstonice, as well as the Mal'ta Venuses, and the Grimaldi Venuses.

In 1976, the Venus of Brassempouy was depicted on a 2 franc stamp. It has also been the motif of a 15 franc (CFA) stamp of the Republic of Mali.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3944476,"Holy Family with the Family of St John the Baptist is an oil-on-canvas painting created c. 1536 by the Italian artist Lorenzo Lotto, and now in the Louvre in Paris. It was probably produced as a private commission, possibly for a Venetian. However, for unknown reasons it remained with the artist, who tried to sell it on before leaving for the Marche in 1549, as recorded in a note in his commonplace books. He sought to use his friend Jacopo Sansovino as his go-between for the work, but Sansovino ended up unable to sell this or any other works by Lotto and returned them all to the painter. 

Lotto tried to sell them off again in 1550, by which time he was in Ancona, this time at a public auction in the Loggia dei Mercanti. This too proved unsuccessful, with Holy Family and most of the other works again remaining unsold. The artist probably took the work to Loreto, where he made a copy of it for the Palazzo Apostolico. The original work passed out of his hands later, possibly via the religious community of Oblates of the Holy House, of which he had become a member. It reappeared in 1662 in an inventory of the French royal collections, having been acquired by an art dealer with a misattribution to Dosso Dossi.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2892964,"The Money Changer and His Wife is a 1514 oil on panel painting by the Flemish renaissance artist Quentin Matsys.

A man, who is weighing the jewels and pieces of gold on the table in front of him sits next to his wife who is reading a book of devotion with an illustration of the Virgin and Child.[1] The couple is not dressed as members of nobility, but rather as well-to-do burghers of Antwerp, where the painting was made. At the time, Antwerp had grown with the influx of many southern immigrants fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. Among this international community there was a demand for money-changers and money-lenders, as international commerce was increasing in the port city. 

The same motif was used 25 years later by Matsys' follower, the painter Marinus van Reymerswaele.

This painting was copied in a painting of the gallery of Cornelis van der Geest by Willem van Haecht a century later in the 1620s. Van der Geest was an admirer of Matsys' work and owned several of his paintings, including The Moneylender and His Wife. He also commemorated Matsys' hundredth death anniversary with a new plaque in the Antwerp Cathedral.[2]

The painting is held in the Louvre.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1167178,"The Painter's Studio: A real allegory summing up seven years of my artistic and moral life (L'Atelier du peintre) is an 1855 oil on canvas painting by Gustave Courbet. It is located in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France.

Courbet painted The Painter's Studio in Ornans, France in 1855.[1] ""The world comes to be painted at my studio,"" said Courbet of the Realist work. The figures in the painting are allegorical representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a landscape, while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of Academic art. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet, mainly elite Parisian society figures, including Charles Baudelaire, Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Courbet's most prominent patron, Alfred Bruyas.[2]

The 1855 Paris World Fair's jury accepted eleven of Courbet's works for the Exposition Universelle, but The Painter's Studio was not among them. In an act of self promotion and defiance, Courbet, with the help of Alfred Bruyas, opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various Salon des Refusés. Very little praise was forthcoming, and Eugène Delacroix was one of the few painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that The Painter's Studio ""represents society at its best, its worst, and its average.""[2]

The painting was produced during Courbet's involvement with Realism in art in the mid-19th century. Due to the short amount of time Courbet had to paint it, many original plans for the work had to be discarded. The most noticeable example of this is in the background of the painting. On the back wall of the studio in the painting, Courbet planned to paint replications of other works of his. He ran out of time to paint these in their entirety, so he then covered them up with a reddish-brown preparation color, leaving the partially-finished paintings still relatively visible.[3]

The left side of the painting depicts people of everyday life in France.[4] The Jewish man and the Irishwoman were seen on a trip Courbet took to London in 1848, according to a letter Courbet wrote to Champfleury describing what the painting would look like.[5] There is also a ""lay figure""/""crucified figure"" directly to the left of Courbet's easel. This figure appears contorted and potentially mangled. Art historians Benedict Nicolson and Georges Riat both interpret this figure as a symbol of the ""death"" of the art of the Royal Academy of Art in France.[6][7]

The center of the painting depicts Courbet painting a landscape, a nude female figure, a young boy, and a white cat. On his canvas, Courbet paints the Loue River valley. This valley in the Franche-Comté region of France is a tribute to Courbet's homeland of Ornans, France.[8] The female figure is based on an 1854 photograph by J. V. de Villeneuve and has been interpreted as a representation of the art of the Academy or as Courbet's Muse for Realism.[9]

The right side of the painting depicts a large number of Paris élites, including friends of the artist. These are figures who played a role in the development of Courbet's career as an artist, or who inspired him in some way. Portrayals included on this side of the painting include Alfred Bruyas (a patron of Courbet's), Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Charles Baudelaire, and a wealthy pair of art collectors, among other prominent society figures.[10] A majority of these portraits were copied from previous portraits or from photographs, since the painting was entirely made in Ornans but the subjects on this side of the painting resided in Paris. For example, the portrait of Charles Baudelaire was directly copied from Courbet's 1847 portrait of the writer.[11] Courbet was in written correspondence with Champfleury in regards to this painting (from which much of the interpretation of The Painter's Studio is derived) and requested a photograph of Proudhon, the philosopher and anarchist, so that he could be included in the painting. It is the photograph Courbet received from Champfleury on which Proudhon's portrait is based.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3222519,"The Ham Dinner (French - Le Déjeuner de jambon) is an oil-on-canvas painting created in 1735 by French artist Nicolas Lancret.[2][3]

It and de Troy's The Oyster Dinner were commissioned by Louis XV to decorate the dining room of the lesser apartments at the Palace of Versailles. Both works are now in the Musée Condé, in Chantilly.

This painting was commissioned in 1734 by King Louis XV from the painter Lancret, for the dining room of the small apartments at the Palace of Versailles, who produced it the following year. A receipt is issued in his name for the sum of 2,400 pounds for the production of this painting. It was the counterpart to Jean-François de Troy's Oyster Lunch. The canvas is then embedded in woodwork. It was in place in 1737 and appears in the inventory of the royal collections at that date. But from 1768, the paintings left the apartments following their reorganization in office rooms and kitchens. In 1784, the paintings are present at the superintendence of the castle.[4]

During the Revolution, the painting was seized and sent to the Central Museum of Arts, ancestor of the Louvre Museum. During the Restoration, in 1817, Louis-Philippe I, then Duke of Orléans, claimed the work as well as its counterpart. He declares that these two works come from the collection of his ancestor, the Regent Philippe d'Orléans, his ancestor, when in reality they never belonged to him. Louis-Philippe sends the two paintings, as well as Le Déjeuner de Chasse, recovered in the same way from his Château d'Eu. His son, the Duke of Aumale acquired it in 1857, during the sale of his father's collections in London. He obtains that the two pendants are withdrawn from sale: The Luncheon of Ham is acquired for 4,000 francs. He installs them in his property of Orleans House in Twickenham. These paintings have a sentimental value for him: his father described to him the names of the characters represented here. According to Jules Guiffrey, it was Philippe d'Orléans, known as le Gros, feasting within the Society of Cotton Bonnets. But apart from the fact that this identification is impossible because of the late date of the painting, art historians today doubt that it could represent characters who really existed. Indeed, the Société des Bonnets de coton was founded in 1760 while Lancret died in 1743 and the Chantilly painting is dated 1735.[5]

Returning to France in 1871, the Duke of Aumale exhibited it in the large gallery of his Château de Chantilly, currently owned by the Institut de France.

The Allegory of Marriage (French: Allégorie Conjugale), also titled the Allegory of Separation (Allégorie de la séparation), and formerly known as the Allegory of Alfonso d'Avalos (Allégorie d'Alphonse d'Avalos), is an oil painting by Titian, made about 1530 to 1535, in the collection of the Louvre.[1] There are several fairly early copies, done after Titian, including two in the Royal Collection.[2]

A well-dressed lady and a gentleman in armor appear on the left of the painting.  They, especially the lady, are attended by a young woman and some children.  The light colours of the lady's dress, a combination of red, green and yellow, enclose her shapely form; beside this mass of strong light the figure of the gentleman in his polished metal breastplate and spaulder stands out dark; turning to the lady, but gazing out of the picture, he lays his hand on her breast.[3]

With them are associated some allegorical figures—a child who represents the God of Love carrying his bow and arrows; a woman with a wreath round her hair, who lays a hand on her breast with a deprecating gesture; and farther to the back, seen strongly foreshortened, the head of a youth, who is holding up a basket laden with flowers.[3] While brightness pervades the foreground, calls out broad lights on the crystal ball and the spaulder, this last figure remains in a rich half-shadow, the head broadly set against a deep blue sky.[4]

Georg Gronau [fr] fancies the Saint Catherine of the London Madonna is the same female figure which is the central object of this picture.[5] He notes the same ""roundness of form"", the same profile, and the same ""golden hair with its rich plaits entwined with strings of pearls"".[5] He also mentions the Girl in a Fur as a point of comparison.[6]


The group was once supposed to represent the parting of Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquis of Vasto, from his young wife, Mary of Aragon, when he was about to set out for war against the Turks.[7] Amor himself, the Goddess of Victory, and Hymen console the grieving lady, who gazes meditatively into a crystal ball she holds in her hand, the symbol of the transient nature of all things human. Relations between this nephew and heir of the Marquis of Pescara and Titian are known to have existed.[3] On 2 November 1531, he wrote to Aretino: ""We want to have Titian here, in Correggio; and if you can do anything to further his coming, I shall be very glad.""[3] But whether this letter is connected with the picture is rather doubtful, in Gronau's view, as the features of the man in armour of the Allegory are not those of the Marquis del Vasto.[3]
Charles Ricketts imagines that the woman who holds a crystal may represent Wisdom or Prudence, and the attendant figures with flowers and wreaths and darts may be the pleasures upon which the armoured warrior turns his back.[9] ""Some trite allegory"", he writes, ""is more likely to be at the root of this 'poesie' than the theory advanced by Crowe and Cavalcaselle that the crystal-gazer is a pensive wife.""[9]

About the traditional name there is certainly some mistake, but the subject remains obscure.[10][1] It was probably painted about 1530 to 1535, at the same period as the Madonna of the Rabbit, or the Madonna with St. Catherine (Aldobrandini Madonna) in London, and not very far in time from the Presentation of the Virgin.[10][1]

The picture was in the collection of Charles I of England at Whitehall, having been acquired at a public sale in Spain, and was copied by Peter Oliver in 1629 and listed in an inventory of 1639.[1][10][11] It was sold in London in 1650, without attribution, as The family of ye Marquess of Guasto.[1] It was owned by Colonel J. Hutchinson of London and Everhard Jabach of Paris, engraved around 1660, and cited in 1661.[1] It was acquired from Jabach by Louis XIV of France in 1662, and is mentioned in an inventory of 1683 (no. 54).[1][10] The various replicas in existence, differing as to detail, show that this composition must have been famous.[10][2] Two early copies in the British Royal Collection may have been painted for Charles I directly from the Titian by Michael Cross (Miguel de la Cruz), a copyist employed by the King in Spain.[2]

It has been suggested that the general composition of The Beloved, a painting of 1865-66 by the English Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882), now in Tate Britain, was influenced by the Titian. The Rossetti shows a group of six figures in a similar circular arrangement.[12]

According to Ricketts, the Allegory in the Louvre was by 1910 in a ""shocking state of partial damage by abrading and retouching, and by centuries of dirt"".[13] The two ladies, as is often the case with popular pictures, have in his view been ""terribly retouched"", and some damage has happened to the exposed bosom of the woman who holds the crystal, some abrasure of the pigment, due possibly to the removal of an added drapery which at one time may have covered it.[9]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29017022,"Allegory of Painting is an artwork attributed in 1988 to the Italian baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi, although more recent research has confirmed it was painted by a Neapolitan anonymous painter in mid-XVIIth century.[1] It hangs in the Musee de Tesse, Le Mans, France.[2]

A nude woman lies on her side, apparently asleep, with her midsection partially covered by drapery. She is surrounded by the tools of an artists, such as a palette, drawing compass and brushes as well as the symbolic mask of imitation.[3] Analysis of x-rays revealed another image under the left arm - a bishop wearing a mitre.[4]

It was first documented in the Popeliniere family, from whom it was acquired by the present owners in 1836.[5]

It could be one of multiple paintings done by Gentileschi with this theme, but the depiction in this particular painting is unusual, and scholars have debated the meaning and attribution. Bissell saw the depiction as too crude to be the work of Artemisia; he instead viewed it as an insult to the family of Orazio Gentileschi, her father, by the hand of his adversary Giovanni Baglione.[3] Christiansen however supported the attribution to Artemisia, relating it to other works of hers from the same period.[6]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q19966728,"Coresus Sacrificing Himself to Save Callirhoe is a large oil-on-canvas painting by the French Rococo artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard, created in 1765. The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1765 and earned Fragonard entry into the Académie Royale.[1]

The story is described in the book Description of Greece (VII, 21), by Pausanias. During a time of plague, the inhabitants of the ancient Greek city of Calydon ask the oracle at Dodona how they might end the plague that has fallen upon the population. The oracle replies that they must sacrifice a beautiful girl named Callirhoe or find someone to die for her. At the climax of the story, the victim is brought to the temple where the head priest, a man named Coresus, who has always loved Callirhoe, has the task of slaying her to save the city. Fragonard's painting depicts Coresus plunging a knife into his body, sacrificing himself to save Callirhoe, who has fainted.[1]

The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1765 and earned Fragonard entry into the Académie Royale. It has been often described as Fragonard's effort to combine his own tendencies with academic requirements and it stands in stark contrast to the paintings for which Fragonard would later be known, erotic domestic scenes and figures of fantasy.

The work was acquired by  Louis XV and is now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.[2] The preparatory sketch for the work belongs to the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Angers, and a ricordo has been part of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid since 1816.[3] Later, Fragonard created a loose chalk sketch of the same scene but at a smaller scale. This drawing is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24283,"The Bridge at Narni (French: Le pont de Narni) is an 1826 painting of the Ponte d'Augusto at Narni by French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. The painting is on display at the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

It was painted in September 1826 and was the basis for the larger and more finished View at Narni, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1827 and is in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.

The view was not a novel one: in 1821 Corot's teacher, Achille-Etna Michallon had drawn the same scene, as had Corot's friend Ernst Fries in 1826. Art historian Peter Galassi describes Corot's study as a reconciliation of traditional and plein air painting objectives:

So deeply did Corot admire Claude and Poussin, so fully did he understand their work, that from the outset he viewed nature in their terms....In less than a year (since his arrival in Rome) he had realized his goal of closing the gap between the empirical freshness of outdoor painting and the organizing principles of classical landscape composition.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q540488,"A Burial at Ornans (French: Un enterrement à Ornans, also known as A Funeral at Ornans) is a painting of 1849–50 by Gustave Courbet. It is widely regarded as a major turning point in 19th-century French art.  The painting records a funeral in Courbet's birthplace, the small town of Ornans. It treats an ordinary, provincial funeral with frank realism, and on the grand scale traditionally reserved for the heroic or religious scenes of history painting. Its exhibition at the 1850–51 Paris Salon created an ""explosive reaction"" and brought Courbet instant fame.[1] It is currently displayed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France

Courbet likely drew inspiration from two different types of sources. One is seventeenth-century Dutch group portraits, such as Banquet of Captain Bicker (1648), Company of Captain Allaert Cloek (1632), or Meagre Company (1637).[2] The other is woodcuts from the 1830s and 40s such as Souvenir Mortuaire (1830), featuring an elevated cross and a grave digger the left, and Degrés des Âges (1830), depicting individuals in a semicircle around a scene of death.[3] While these all likely had an impact on the creation of the painting, Courbet scholar Gerstle Mack claims that the original inspiration for the painting most likely came from the funeral of Oudot, Courbet's grandfather, who had died a year before he created the painting. According to another theory, the painting is based on a funeral for a member of the Proudhon family; Courbet was close with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and some of the figures in Burial are said to resemble members of the family.[4] Courbet made a sketch prior to the final work, and the people of Ornans posed as models.[3]

At the bottom center of the painting, there is an open grave with a skull and bones along its edge. Behind the grave stands a group of attendees, arranged loosely in three groups: church members, veterans with a dog, and other officials and mourners. The members of the church include a priest, a cross bearer, choir boys, and beadles.[5] The crucifix held by the cross bearer looms above the figures in the painting. Courbet described the two figures standing with the white dog as ""two old veterans of the Revolution of '93"" who wear ""the clothes of their time.""[6] The two figures have since been identified as Secrétan and Cardet, both friends of Courbet's grandfather. The figure among the crowd in the back on the far left of the painting has also been identified as Oudot, Courbet's grandfather.[7]

The painting places the figures in a linear structure, arranging them alongside of each other. For this reason, some have described it as an additive mode of composition that focuses on the juxtaposition of figures. Others push back on this notion, claiming that the proximity of the figures along with their similar colors of costume unify them as though they are physically merged, not allowing the viewers attention to rest on one person at a time. Each figure also appears to receive relatively equal emphasis, making the composition of the painting anti-hierarchical. Additionally, the linear nature of the painting suggests a lateral movement, which is reinforced by the final painting and the original sketch having unusual proportions, being much wider than tall.[8]

By 1848, Courbet showed an interest in representing common people in a realistic manner. He expressed in letters his belief that his art was democratic. By depicting the townspeople of Ornans at a grand scale that was previously reserved for history paintings, Courbet declared the importance of ordinary, rural people to the Parisian public at the Salon. The provocative presentation of an ordinary subject in a large format has led many commentators to see the work as a political statement.[9] This interpretation was especially common among Courbet's contemporaries who praised it for its realism, as well as for the democratic and socialist ideals it represented.[10]

The composition of the painting has provided further support for this political interpretation. The horizontal format, with all figures represented on roughly the same level, delivered a seemingly egalitarian and socialist message.[11]

Art historian T.J. Clark, however, has argued that the sociopolitical message of the painting is complex. Clark emphasizes the painting's stillness, ambiguity, and irony. At the time of the paintings creation, there was tension between peasants and the bourgeoisie, and though this painting may depict the rural bourgeoisie, it does not, according to Clark, take a stance on them. Clark instead claims that the painting simply represents rural French life, its structure, and permanence.[12] Clark relates this message to the personal position of Courbet, whose family was not fully bourgeois, but was wealthy enough to own two homes. Rather than see the painting in terms of left and right politics, Clark interprets it as being about the subject of class.[13]

Other commentators have rejected both politics and class as key to the painting's meaning. Some have simply interpreted it as Courbet's effort to depict an event that took place in his hometown. The art critic Champfleury wrote at the time, ""there is not a trace of socialism in A Burial at Ornans ... Fortunately, M. Courbet has not tried to prove anything by his Burial. It represents death of a citizen who is escorted to his last resting place by other citizens ... It has pleased the painter to show us the domestic life of a small town ... As to the alleged ugliness of the townspeople, there is nothing exaggerated about it.""[14]

The skull and bones sit at the bottom of the painting between the veterans and the clergymen. Its placement between groups of two opposing ideologies is thought to potentially comment on ""human aspirations and failures,"" showing the pointlessness of idealogical contests, while also serving to emotionally move viewers.[15] This interpretation sees the skull as an expression of Courbet's discontent with both traditional and revolutionary values. The skull is placed on the side of the grave closer to the veterans, which has sometimes been seen as a comment on revolutionaries. In traditional paintings of crucifixions, the side that the skull is placed on symbolizes those who ""thrive on death,"" making the skull a potential comment on the violence of revolution.[16]

The prominent position of the crucifix above all other figures is thought to symbolize the importance of Catholicism and traditional social values among the rural French population. At the same time, the inattentiveness of the church figures may serve as a witty commentary on the emptiness of the ritual they perform.[17] Clark observes that there are all the elements of the burial ritual without their unison. Those attending the service are portrayed as indifferent to the presence of religion within the service, which may be interpreted as Courbet separating the two.[18] Contemporary critics such as Proudhon also noticed this. He saw spirituality as being important in the death of a human, and he took the impious atmosphere of the scene to be a commentary on France losing its faith. Others, such as Hélène Toussaint, would later argue that the crucifix itself is a representation of hope that, after the 1848 Revolution, Christianity could be the basis for a rebuilding of French unity. This interpretation has often been disregarded due to the disconnect between those in the painting and the crucifix.[10]

The two veterans of the Revolution of '93 are represented in the painting in a light that was common at the time. They are worn down and old, standing proudly next to the grave, skull, and bones. Historian James C. McCarthy argues that their appearance likely represents both the contempt and compassion that Courbet felt towards them. McCarthy claims that the figures stood as a representation of ""old-fashioned intransigence, a lack of contact with the latest revolutionary ideals, and a sense of frustration mingled with a certain bitterness."" Additionally, Courbet may have represented them in this way due to his belief in non-violence. He described himself as a pacifist both early in life and later in his autobiography. He also expressed his disdain for violence after witnessing some of the horrors of the 1848 Revolution.[17]

Much of the controversy surrounding A Burial at Ornans centered on its monumental size. Its large scale had previously been reserved for history paintings, which academic doctrine held to be the highest genre. By depicting rural life at such a grand scale, Courbet scandalized audiences. In addition to the size, critics were displeased by the ugliness of the painting. They saw the composition as being crowded, disorganized, and without a clear focal point.[19]

The work was also criticized for its impious presentation of death. At the time, scenes of death and funerals often delivered a religious message. This was true of the woodcuts that influenced Courbet. For example, Degrés des Âges presents a scene of heaven and hell underneath an aging couple. Many paintings of the subject also represent funeral attendees as mourning or pious, with the clergy shown as devoted. Both of these elements are absent in Burial. Some viewers may have seen this fact as a rightful criticism of contemporary funeral rituals. In 1849, there was a cholera outbreak, during which the funeral industry was faulted for price gouging. Additionally, questions had grown about the presence of the church and its efficacy. Some commentators also saw the painting as a scandalous celebration of France's declining religious faith.[20]

While the painting was criticized for its ugliness and impiety, it was also praised for its realism and unprecedented representation of rural France.[19]

Courbet is widely regarded as a leader of French Realism. Burial, as one of Courbet's most controversial works, helped bring Realism to the attention of the public. Additionally, some historians, such as Mack, believe that Courbet had an influence on the Impressionist movement. According to Mack, Courbet's works, and Burial in particular, allowed artists to explore new ways of painting and new subject matter.[21]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29656887,"Stag Hunt (French: Chasse au cerf) is an oil on canvas painting by Flemish painter Paul Bril. It was probably painted in the 1590s, and is currently housed at the Louvre in Paris.[1] The painting was once part of the collection of Louis XIV.[1][2][3]

Paul Bril completed this painting during his stay in Rome, where he moved in the late 1570s or early 1580s.[4][5][6] In Rome, Bril went on to become the most influential landscapist of his time.[5][7]

Bril painted imaginary landscapes typical of the Flemish tradition, following the example of painters such as Joachim Patinir, Herri met de Bles and Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The early work of Hans Bol was also a source of inspiration for Bril.[5]

Bril and the Flemish landscapists didn't either paint nor draw studies en plein air. This painting, too, is a studio product from the artist's imagination. In the painting, six hunters are hunting down a stag into a marsh, illuminated by discernible rays of sunlight. Two hunters are riding a horse, one is in the foreground, the other is visible in a clearing among the trees closing the painting to the left, in the background. On the bottom right, some rabbits are running away or taking refuge below the rooted bank. From the rider's horse jumping forward in the foreground, the painting recedes, in a slanted and undulated view, to the bosky landscape visible through an opening. The strong colors and the skillful articulation thereof in the landscape as well as the quality of the animal animation, far superior to that of Bril's Chasse au daim (""Fallow deer Hunt,"" INV. 1108, also at the Louvre), confirm the attribution of the Deer Hunt to Paul Bril. The painting was part of the collection of King Luis XVI of France, who acquired it from a merchant Alvarez in 1682.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47169543,"Christ Triumphant over Sin and Death, also known as Christ Triumphant over Death and Sin, or sometimes as Salvator Mundi, is a circa 1618 oil painting by the Flemish Baroque artist Peter Paul Rubens. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 235.[2]

The painting represents the allegorical victory of Christianity over Death (depicted as a skull) and Sin (depicted as a snake). It was formerly thought to have been painted around 1615, but more recent stylistic comparisons with similar Rubens works have indicated that it was more likely to have been painted slightly later, i.e. around 1618. The painting could have been commissioned for an altar in a private chapel; it was held in high esteem in the 18th century and is well document since 1745. It was bought for the museum by Wilhelm von Bode in 1890 at a sale at Christie's, and entered the collections in 1891.[1][3]

Christ's head and right arm are painted in a smoother, softer texture than the rest of his body or indeed of the painting as a whole. While the work is accepted as a genuine Rubens, the customary participation of his workshop is not excluded.[2][1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9372007,"The Pardo Venus is a painting by the Venetian artist Titian, completed in 1551 and now in the Louvre Museum.  It is also known as Jupiter and Antiope, since it seems to show the story of Jupiter and Antiope from Book VI of the Metamorphoses (lines 110-111). It is Titian's largest mythological painting,[1] and was the first major mythological painting produced by the artist for Philip II of Spain.  It was long kept in the Royal Palace of El Pardo near Madrid (not to be confused with the Prado, a purpose-built museum), hence its usual name; whether Venus is actually represented is uncertain. It later belonged to the English and French royal collections.

Analysis of its style and composition shows that Titian modified a Bacchanalian scene he had begun much earlier in his career by completing the landscape background and adding figures. For Sydney Freedberg it was ""probably in substance an invention of the later 1530s, though significantly reworked later; it is full of motifs and ideas that have been recollected from an earlier and more Giorgionesque time, ordered in an obvious and uncomplicated classicizing scheme.""[2]

Though, if Antiope is the nude, the painting meets the basic definition of Titian's poesie series, mythological scenes from Ovid painted for Philip II, the painting is typically not counted in the series, either as it was begun well before Titian used the term in a letter to the Spanish King, or because the nude is indeed Venus, in which case no such scene is described by Ovid.[3]

As to the subject, Titian himself appears to describe it simply as ""the landscape"", and his son Orazio calls it ""the nude woman with the landscape and the satyr"", both in letters to Philip II, but later an inventory of El Pardo calls it ""Jupiter and Antiope"".[4] In Madrid in the 1620s, Vicente Carducho (d. 1638, see below) referred to its subject as ""Antiope and some shepherds and satyrs on a large canvas"".[5] In the correspondence of the French and Spanish ambassadors as Charles I's collection was being sold in 1649-53, the nude is ""Venus"".[6]  Malcolm Bull observed: ""In later inventories the terms ""naked woman"" and ""Venus"" are almost interchangeable"", and the presence of her son Cupid an uncertain indicator, as he often appears with other people.[7]

The painting is very large, and the figures somewhat disconnected, the composition divided into two by the tree at centre. In the right foreground we have a scene that would have been familiar to well-educated Renaissance viewers as Jupiter, having taken the form of a satyr, creeping up on the sleeping nymph Antiope, and lifting her drapery to view her naked. He will shortly rape her.  Possibly the situation is only borrowed from this story, but all Titian's other mythological paintings for Philip show scenes from Ovid, where Antiope's story features (Metamorphoses, VI, 110-111).  Scenes of satyr voyeurism or sexual assault, given titles such as Nymph Surprised by a Satyr, are found in art, mostly later than this, but only a very rash satyr would treat the goddess Venus in this way.  The painting can be compared to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians of 1523-24 (Prado), where an apparently unconscious nude in a version of the Dresden Venus pose shares the picture space with a group of revellers in a mixture of nudity, contemporary and classical dress.

Venus or Antiope sleeps as yet undisturbed, not only by the voyeur, but a hunting scene above her, where hounds have brought down a stag, and immediately left of her, a satyr or faun with the legs of a goat seated on the ground, in conversation with a lady in contemporary dress.  Immediately beside them stands a hunter, with large dogs, and at far left another huntsman blows a horn.[8]

Over Venus' head, Cupid perches in a tree, with an arrow in his bow, apparently pointed at Jupiter.  In the middle distance a naked couple, apparently both women, talk or kiss on the banks of a river.  The river has a wide waterfall above the stag, and presumably then flows above the conversing couple before perhaps circling round behind the viewer to create the water behind the Jupiter/satyr, but this is not shown clearly, which is rather typical of Titian.  To the right, the landscape includes a contemporary farmhouse at the top of the rise, and a distant settlement dominated by a church tower and steeple.  Distant mountains complete the view, which like many Titian landscapes reflects the country between Venice and his hometown of Pieve di Cadore in the mountains, though he does not seem to have closely depicted specific locations.[9]

Art historians have struggled somewhat in trying to find a coherent meaning for these disparate elements.  Their incongruous combination makes it something of a test case for a long-running dispute over the extent to which Titian's mythological paintings (and to some extent those of Venetian painters in general) carry ""great complexity of allegorical meanings"", in the way that some works of other Renaissance artists are generally accepted to do.[10]

Harold Wethey was not impressed by the idea that the different elements represented different modes of life: ""active"" in the hunters, ""voluptuous"" in Venus/Antiope  and Jupiter, and ""contemplative"" in the couple sitting on the grass.[11]  Another line of thinking is to compare Venus to the stag brought down by the hounds, the stag then becoming a cerf fragile, in an old Gothic visual metaphor with the hunted stag representing the life and trials of Christ or man.  This draws on a wealth of imagery in religious writings, ultimately going back to Psalm 41/42: ""As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.."".[12]

Alternatively it can be seen as an essentially decorative piling-up of different groups of subject matter with no overall complex meaning intended, but an impressive effect.

The painting is a development of Titian's compositions with a reclining female nude in the Venetian style.  The pose of the Pardo Venus, recalling a Venus pudica pose with one arm covering the genitals, is similar to that in Giorgione's Dresden Venus, which  was completed by Titian after Giorgione's death in 1510.  Around 1534 Titian had painted the Venus of Urbino, and a similar scene from 1545, perhaps a lost recorded Venus sent to Charles V, ""was the basis"" for the Venus and Musician series, which exists in several versions.[13]  Unlike the others, the Cupid in most versions of Venus and Musician, and probably in the Pardo Venus, does allow a clear identification of the female as Venus.[14] However, allusions to the goddess elevate such images from the profane category of  courtesans.[15]

Kenneth Clark described the Pardo Venus as a ""laboured attempt to recapture his early style"", and the Dresden/Urbino pose here ""much coarsened"".[16]  A more original composition and physique, also begun in the mid-1540s, but with versions painted in the 1550s and perhaps 1560s, is used in the series of Danaë paintings, which Clark sees as Titian adopting the conventions for the nude prevailing outside Venice; ""in the rest of Italy bodies of an entirely different shape had long been fashionable"".[17]

For Clark, the Venus of the Venus and Musician versions, where the head changes direction but the body remains exactly the same, is ""entirely Venetian, younger sister of all those expensive ladies whom Palma Vecchio, Paris Bordone and Bonifazio painted for local consumption.""[18]

In 1574, Titian had still not been paid for the painting, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and favourite Antonio Pérez. The painting was still in El Pardo when most of the palace burnt down in 1603, with the loss of several Titians and other important art. Vicente Carducho  (1576/78–1638), an Italian-born court painter in Spain, records that when he heard the news, the first question of King Philip III of Spain was to ask if the Venus had been lost. Told that it survived, he is said to have commented ""I am satisfied, for the rest will be redone"".[19]

Despite this prestige, the painting was given to Charles I of England in 1623 when, as Prince of Wales, he made a quixotic, unauthorized and unplanned visit to Madrid to try to acquire a Spanish bride.[20]  A copy made in London hangs in Ham House. After Charles' execution, the valuers assessing his collection in Whitehall Palace found the ""great Lardge and famous peece"" in the ""Second and Middle Privie Lodging Roome"", along with the Venus and Musician now in the Prado, and valued them at £500 and £150 respectively.[21]  They were both bought on the same day in 1649 at one of the sales of Charles' art collection by Colonel John Hutchinson, who paid £600 and £165.[22] Hutchinson was buying as an investment, and as the major continental collectors realized the situation and organized agents, he sold all his major purchases within a few years.[23]

Alonso de Cárdenas the Spanish ambassador, managing purchases in England a year or two later, declined to buy the Pardo Venus, preferring Correggio's Venus with Mercury and Cupid ('The School of Love') (now National Gallery, London), as ""no es tan profano como la otra, Venus dormido y el Satyro"" (""it is not as profane as the other, Venus sleeping and the satyr"").[24] In 1653, Hutchinson skillfully negotiated Bordeaux-Neufville, who combined the roles of French ambassador and Cardinal Mazarin's art agent, into paying £1,200 for it.[25] It was acquired from Mazarin's heirs in 1661 by Louis XIV of France, and remained in the French royal collection until this passed to the Louvre Museum.[26]

The painting depicts the goddess Venus mourning the death of her mortal lover Adonis after he was gored by a boar whilst hunting. She is pouring nectar onto his wounds after which a scarlet anemone flower would spring up from his blood to his permanent memory. The nearby chariot is reminiscent of Pluto, representing a symbol of death. The two doves perched thereon are attributes of Venus.[1]

The story of Venus and Adonis, as narrated in Ovid's Metamorphoses, was a popular subject in Baroque times as an allegory for death and rebirth and had parallels with the Christian belief in Christ's resurrection. In the painting Adonis' posture is reminiscent of the crucified Christ and Venus' actions akin to those of Saint Mary.

The work found its way into the French royal collection before being sent to Caen.

It is also known as Young Greeks Attending a Cock Fight (Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs). It is an example of the Neo-Grec style. It was one of Gérôme's first successes.[1]

After his failed attempt to win the Prix de Rome, Gérôme was hesitant to exhibit The Cock Fight out of fear for another setback, but was convinced by his teacher Paul Delaroche to enter it into the 1847 Salon. It was well received at the Salon and was sold to Mr. Roux-Laborie.[1][2]

The art dealer Adolphe Goupil bought it from the widowed Countess H. de Bussat, born Laborie, in 1872 and sold it to the Musée du Luxembourg in 1873. From 1920 to 1986 it was at the Louvre, and since 1986 it is housed at the Musée d'Orsay.[2]

In it, Courbet depicts himself in a romantic theme as a suffering, heroic man. Originally, the composition featured a woman leaning on the artist's shoulder. Sometime before May 1854, Courbet replaced her with a sword, and added a red bloodstain on his shirt.[1] Courbet's decision to depict himself as a wounded man may have arisen from his distress at the dissolution, circa 1851, of his 14-year relationship with Virginie Binet, with whom he had a son.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3463874,"St John the Baptist in the Desert is a c.1516-1517 oil painting by Raphael and his assistants, including Giulio Romano. The composition is thought to be by Raphael himself, who may also have drafted some of the sections of the finished work. It is now in the Louvre in Paris. Originally on panel, it was transferred to a canvas support in 1777 - the practice was quite common in French collections at that period.[1]

Its depiction of John the Baptist as a young boy draws on Michelangelo's 'ignudi' from the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The background includes the coats of arms of the La Tremouille family and of its commissioner, Adrien Gouffier de Boissy, cardinal and Grand Almoner of France under Francis I. In 1532 the work was placed in the collegiate church of Saint-Maurice in Oiron by Boissy's nephew Claude Gouffier, husband to a member of the La Tremoille family, meaning that both coats of arms must have been added at that date.[citation needed]

In 1660 the count of La Feuillade offered the painting to Louis XIV of France.[2] At the request of the Duke of Maillé the painting was transferred from the royal collection to the parish church of Longpont. It was later bought at the posthumous sale of Duke's collection by the art dealer Cousin and entered the French national collection in 1838.[citation needed]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2343778,"La Belle Jardinière, also known as the Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist, is a painting started by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, and finished by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, that depicts the Madonna, a young Christ, and a young John the Baptist. It is believed to have been commissioned by the Sienese patrician Fabrizio Sergardi in approximately 1507.[1][2] It is currently displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.

This painting is considered one of the most famous Madonna portraits of Italian Renaissance painter, Raphael. Many art historians believe that this painting is the peak of Raphael's achievements and one of his strongest pieces from his Florentine phase.[3] Raphael began to paint La Belle Jardinière after finishing Madonna of the Goldfinch. This work also mirror his next piece Madonna of the Meadow.

Raphael was unable to complete this painting before he left Florence. It was later finished by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio.[2] Ghirlandaio is especially credited for completing the blue robe of Mary. The painting was later taken to Paris by King Francis I of France,  where it gained in popularity and was copied by many other artists.[1]

The painting portrays Mary, Christ and a young John the Baptist. Mary is the focus of the painting. Her face is situated at the apex of the pyramidal composition and her body fills most of the rest. She is holding the Christ child, who is standing at her foot to her right. John the Baptist is on the ground to the left of Mary and is holding his reed cross with his right hand. Mary is holding a book in the hand that is resting on her lap. There are faint halos around all of their heads, a feature that disappears in the High Renaissance. The landscape of the painting is that of a beautiful countryside garden. Raphael used a unified naturalistic composition with rich and luminous colors and blended light and shadows to help create a highly realistic atmosphere.

One of this painting's defining features is the Madonna. She is the focus of the painting.[2] She has a protective arm around Christ as he looks up at her while standing on one of her feet, showing a sense of dependency and childlike trust.[4] On the other side kneels John the Baptist holding one of the two religious symbols seen in the work. Raphael diverged from the previous practice of placing multiple religious symbols in a piece. Instead he combines religious iconography and beautiful landscapes to show both humanism and the teaching of the Catholic Church. The other religious symbol seen is the faint halos that disappeared as artists entered the High Renaissance. The book that the Madonna is holding is believed to contain the foretelling of Christ's death.[4] The way Raphael composed the painting creates a sense of intimacy between Mary and Christ, with John the Baptist as witness. The positions of Mary and Christ, and to a lesser extent John the Baptist, serve as a prefiguration of the Passion and eventual death of Christ.[5] The book Mary hold tells of these eventual events.

Raphael studied the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Fra Bartolommeo while in Florence. He traded his use of stiff compositions that were popular during his Umbrian phase in favor of a newer style influenced by his study of these other artist.[6] This painting in particular appears to be derived from Leonardo's models, such as The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne.[7]

The painting echoes the spacious landscapes of Pietro Perugino. He also utilized the popular pyramid composition common with art in the High Renaissance as well as the sfumato technique. Another feature seen in La Belle Jardinière is the highly idealized beauty and grace of the Madonna. Despite taking inspiration from other artist, Raphael was able to move past just recreating others works and add his own styles to benefit his works.[6]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15992468,"Romulus' Victory Over Acron (Romulus, Conqueror of Acron) is a painting completed in 1812 by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Ingres' source for this subject comes from Plutarch's Life of Romulus. The painting depicts the war that resulted from the Roman abduction of the young Sabine women in an effort to remedy the shortage of women in the newly founded city of Rome. In retaliation Acron, the king of the neighbouring tribe, the Caeninenses, declared war upon the Romans. He and his tribesmen were mercilessly defeated and their city sacked by the Romans.[2]

The subject, style and size of the piece make it clear that this piece embodies the Neoclassical tradition. At 276 x 530cm it is one of Ingres’ largest paintings and this grand scale is consistent with his previous classical subject paintings, such as Jupiter and Thetis.[4] The canvas is cast in the form of a long frieze, a style traditional of the ancient world. Ingres introduces several motifs from ancient art; the horse for example is a clear homage to the marble horse of the Parthenon frieze. Ingres also uses tempera to evoke the matte quality of ancient Roman frescos.[5]

In the painting there is an element of stunted action which creates a somewhat icy and unemotional aspect which is a feature of the new Gothic style that was emerging forcefully in the early 19th century.[5]

It is not just from the ancient world that Ingres took his inspiration. Elements of the painting recall the work of Jacques-Louis David, Europe's leading painter at the turn of the century and Ingres' master with whom he studied for four years. Romulus' Victory Over Acron has several points of similarity with David's The Intervention of the Sabine Women of 1799. The figure of Ingres' slain Acron closely matches that of his master's dead Sabine. The shield, depicting the she-wolf and infant twins Romulus and Remus characteristic of the Roman foundation myth, is also the same save that Ingres omitted the inscription. The warrior to the extreme left of the Sabines, whose stance derives from the antique, finds a fairly confirming echo in Ingres' victorious Romulus.[6] It has also been suggested that the pose of Romulus was inspired by a fragment of a Roman bas-relief after a work by Phidias, a classical Greek sculptor.[7]

The painting—together with The Dream of Ossian—was commissioned by General Miollis in 1811 for Napoleon Bonaparte's residence, the Palazzo Monte Cavallo (now the Palazzo Quirinale) and was intended as decoration of the empress's second salon.[4] In 1815 the Romulus was taken out of the Quirinale and brought to the Palazzo di San Giovanni in Laterano. In 1857 it was given by Pope Pius IX to Napoleon III who presented it to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where it was hung in the Amphithéatre d'Honneur,[7] until 1969 when it was deposited at the Louvre. In January 2017 it returned to the Ecole des Beaux-arts for restoration before being re-installed in the newly restored Amphithéatre d'Honneur (May 2017).[8]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5108945,"Christ at the Column is a small painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Antonello da Messina, executed c. 1476–1478, showing the Flagellation of Christ. It is in the Louvre in Paris.

Painted in his final years, the pictures shows Antonello's assimilation of the Early Netherlandish and Venetian influences into a mature art. For long time the unusual small size and close-up view of the subject led scholars to think that the work had been cut down and originally extended lower, and that originally a parapet separated Christ from the watchers. This theory has been proved to be wrong.

The face of Christ was a common theme in Antonello's art: however, portraying Christ in the middle of his pain, in the moment in which the tortures have just begun, Antonello managed to obtain an emotive impact sometimes lacking in his similar works.

As usual, Antonello devoted high attention to the rendering of details: the sweaty hair, the beard (each hair of which can be distinguished), the half open mouth, in which teeth and tongue can be seen, the first stripes of blood marking the face, the perfectly transparent drops.

Although the work cannot have been painted in the open air due to its large dimensions, Daubigny certainly tried to capture the fleeting reality of a Summer day in the country. The work stands out for its light colors and loose brushstrokes. Many other painters of the Barbizon School used a much darker palette. Daubigny showed himself to be a forerunner of the Impressionists. This is especially evident around the horizon, where only a few horizontally placed brushstrokes, each of a different color, can be seen.

In this painting, the whole countryside is marked out in blue squares that seems like a chessboard. All of the activities are picturesquely grouped around a golden blaze such as men doubled over, women hurrying along the narrow paths, and people stooking sheaves of corn and loading carts.

The painting was exhibited at the Paris salon of 1852. The work was very successful and marked a breakthrough in the painter's career. The brothers Edmond and Jules de Goncourt devoted a long review in high praise of the work: ""Men harvest bent and women hurry along the narrow paths and sheaves are tied and wagons loaded. All these activities come together picturesquely in a golden glow, in which a brush without paint makes a plow furrow sparkle here and there (...). The grain harvest has never been better depicted; (...) and Mr Daubigny's painting is a masterpiece, despite the neglect of the background.""

Daubigny made the painting at the behest of the French Minister of the Interior for 2,500 francs. In 1853, the French state bought the work. It will hang in the Ministry of Justice. In 1907 it was transferred to the Louvre, in Paris. In 1986, it was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5659824,"The Young Beggar is a (circa 1645–1650) genre painting by Spanish painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Also known as The Lice-Ridden Boy due to the figure of a young boy delousing himself in the painting, The Young Beggar is the first known depiction of a street urchin by Murillo.[1]

It was influenced by the poverty of Spanish children in the 17th century and followed the style of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio.[2] Murillo's painting focuses on an orphaned child and uses a complementary technique of light and shade.[3] It has been viewed as one of his most popular works of the Spanish Baroque painting and was once kept in the royal collection of Louis XVI.[4]

It is currently located in the Louvre Museum in Paris.[1]

Paintings of children in poverty were greatly appreciated in Flanders due to the long Flemish tradition of low-life genre scenes, including tavern scenes.[5]

As one of the last great painters of Spain's Golden Age, Murillo was above all a religious painter, known for his grand depictions of saints and Christ. His interest in the poor was perhaps related to the doctrine of charity of the Franciscans, for whom he frequently worked. For the Franciscans of Seville, he painted a cycle of pictures to which another painting titled, The Angels' Kitchen, belongs.[6]

This work of art was undoubtedly inspired by the rampant misery in the streets of Seville during the Golden Age.[2] In the 17th century, Spain had a dilemma with abandoned children who had to fend for themselves.[2] The Young Beggar depicts one of these children who is in the middle of  ridding himself of lice.

Murillo was inspired to create a series of genre paintings featuring orphaned children living on the streets of Seville as a result of poor management in seventeenth-century Spain.[2] Not only was there conflict among people because of differences in religion, there were also plagues that affected the children.[2] It was these particular hardships that became the subjects of Murillo's paintings.[2]

Murillo could have been influenced to create such works due to his upbringing and he drew inspiration from what surrounded him.[7] As a child, he was orphaned and raised by relatives.[2] His childhood could have also inspired this series of street children.[2]

Murillo's paintings of poor class citizens and low-life youths were also influenced by the popularity of Spanish picaresque literature of the time as well.[3] Works by novelist Miguel de Cervantès, who was known for depicting stories of roguish heroes and foolish knights, were an enormous inspiration for Murillo.[3]

The Young Beggar is unlike Murillo's earlier works, which followed the style of his teacher Jorge Castillo and artists like Francisco de Zurbarán and Alonzo Cano.[8] Instead, it uses stark contrasts of light and shade, much like the style of Italian painter, Caravaggio.[2]

It shows the exquisite style of Murillo, who used skilled brushworks as well as chiaroscuro, giving an intimate detail to his subject.[8] This style influenced future artists like Sir Joshua Reynolds, John Constable, and Édouard Manet.[2]

Murillo uses a complementary contrast between light and shade, also known as tenebrism, as seen with the windowsill on the top left of the painting. The boy sits on the opposite corner at the bottom right, clearing his body from lice. His clothes are torn and seem to have been resown using materials from other rags. By the boy's left knee is a pile of half eaten shrimp, and by his right leg on the left side of the painting is a basket of apples.

Based on the scraps of shrimp and basket of apples on the floor, it can be interpreted that this boy is resting after having eaten.[8]

The act of delousing oneself can be seen as a way of being in control of one's own mind and body, a hygienic act often done by mothers in Dutch genre paintings.[9]

What makes The Young Beggar emotionally appealing is how the boy is unaffected by his poor circumstance.[2] The boy has been compared to a horse named Rocinante from the picaresque novel, Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantès, who had an odd personality and took on overbearing tasks.[2] Rocinante was seen as a low-quality horse who was infested with pests like the boy.[2]

Unlike Murillo's religious works, The Young Beggar was not immediately praised as a high work of art.[8] Murillo was criticized for being too focused on creating an idealized urchin, which did not truly reflect the harsh realities of Spanish poverty in Seville.[2]

This painting was also criticized for using glaring lights and poses that were often too dramatic or theatrical. However, this criticism was later disputed as subsequent interpretations viewed this as a virtue of the work; because the young boy in the painting was not affected by his poor condition, it was what made him appealing.[10]

Yet Murillo's works suffered when other artists attempted to create poor copies of the same subject; however what affected his reputation most was due to the artist himself never signing many of his artworks.[2]

It was not until the Rococo period when The Young Beggar and similar themed paintings of street children became more valued.[7] Outside of Spain, Murillo's skill in representing children on the streets was praised.[7] Recorded around 1658, this painting was on display in Gray's Inn, London, proving how the original was moved outside of Seville as early as the 1650s.[7] Similar paintings like Boys Eating Grapes and Melon, originally named Two Spanish Boys Eating Grapes, was another such painting that secured Murillo's popularity beyond his Spanish home.[7]

Murillo's paintings of street urchins and begging children became popular towards the end of the Baroque period and were sold to private collectors in the cities of Antwerp, Rotterdam, and London.[7] They were mostly bought by merchants and collectors who wanted the works for their own private displays.[7]

The Young Beggar was among Murillo's most popular pieces and was bought by a dealer named Lebrun, which was then given to Louis XVI for his royal collection.[4] This was a rare accomplishment since Murillo was only one of three Spanish painters who had their works put in the collection, the other two being Diego Velázquez and Francisco Collantes.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7743869,"The Junta of the Philippines, or Sessions of the Junta of the Royal Company of the Philippines (Spanish: Junta de la Compañía de Filipinas) is an oil-on-canvas painting, c. 1815, by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya held by the Goya Museum located in Castres.

The work is the largest Goya produced.[1] It was commissioned that year to commemorate the March 30th annual meeting of the Royal Company of the Philippines (Real Compañía de Filipinas) attended by 51 shareholders and members[2] during a period when Goya was disillusioned by the formerly exiled Ferdinand VII's return to the Spanish crown, which moved away from enlightenment and ended the hopes of Spanish liberals for a more progressive Spain.[3]

The Junta of the Philippines painting captures a moment when, unexpectedly, Ferdinand decided to attend the meeting of the Junta, intending his presence to be an affirmation of his commitment to the empire. However, it had the opposite effect; the Spanish economy and empire lay in ruins after the Peninsular War,[1] the Royal Company of the Philippines was by that time so unprofitable and ineffective as to be irrelevant, and Ferdinand was a king who had learned nothing from the turmoil of the preceding years when he was overthrown. Ferdinand's return led to mass emigration and exile amongst the Spanish intellectual class. Although Goya remained in Spain for a number of years and continued to depict his king, he too fled in exile to France in 1824.[4]

As with his c. 1800 Charles IV of Spain and His Family, the Spanish king is portrayed in full pomp and finery, albeit through barely concealed gritted teeth. Ferdinand is shown in the center middle-ground, seated at a raised table and flanked by trembling associates. To his left sits Miguel de Lardazibal, minister for the Indies, who was imprisoned the following September and forced into exile by the crown. Before these men, the assembly members are massed in two groups divided left and right by carpet. An expanse of light spills across the floor, spread before the absolute monarch, and lit from a source situated near the viewer of the painting.[2] While the work was painted on commission and intended to hang in the ceremonial hall in which it was set,[2] it highlights in an unflattering manner the centrality and impotent grip of the king. To art historian Albert Boime, the painting shows a monarch who rules not through respect, but through last resort; absolute power and fear.[5]

This painting was inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi by the Ottoman forces in 1826, during which many people of the city after the long-time siege (almost a year) decided to attempt a mass breakout (sortie) to escape famine and epidemics. The attempt resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain.

She is wearing a traditional Greek costume, her chest being widely bare, and she spreads her arms as a sign of sadness. The hand of a dead victim can be seen protruding from the rubble, beneath her feet. In the background, a dark-complexioned man wearing a yellow turban, who symbolizes the enemy, is planting a flag in the ground.[1]

The painting borrows elements from Christianity. Indeed, ""Greece adopts the attitude of praying in the early centuries of Christianity. The blue coat and white robe, traditionally attributed to the Immaculate Conception, reinforces this analogy to a secular figure of Mary here. The strength of the image is the sharp contrast between the traditional allegory which induces an idealization of the model, and processing of the scene without any concession to the ideal.""[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6485124,"Landscape with Orpheus and Eurydice is a 124 × 200 cm (approx 4 × 6.5 feet) oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Nicolas Poussin, painted between 1650 and 1653. It depicts a mythological subject in the classical style and is in the collection of the Louvre in Paris.

Nicolas Poussin painted this work for his longtime friend and patron Jean Pointel, who was a rich banker in Paris. Pointel also was a member of the libertines,[clarification needed] a circle which Poussin himself frequented. It was in Pointel's collection, which had many works by Poussin, but was stored away after the political climate in Paris changed. In its place Poussin`s landscape with snake and dying man, was hung in Pointel`s private collection.[citation needed]

Poussin places the story of Orpheus in the Campagna Romana (Roman countryside): the Castel Sant'Angelo and the Torre delle Milizie (""Tower of the Militia"") figure in this painting, borrowed from the landscape of the Eternal City.[1] Dense smoke pours from a fire which devastates the Castle, and darkens a sky already overcast with sombre clouds. The fall of the light divides the landscape diagonally into bright and dark areas – a division clearly seen on the Torre delle Milizie.[2]

Many of Poussin's pictures have darkened, mainly as a result of a red underpainting which has begun to show through the colours. The Orpheus, however, is free of this: it has kept its original transparency even in the darker passages, and the whole painting is in a particularly fine state of preservation.[3]

This work by Poussin remains cryptic and there are various opinions about possible ways to decipher it.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6508106,"Le ruisseau noir (The Black Stream) (also known in En. as Stream in a Ravine) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painted by French artist, Gustave Courbet, in 1865. It is currently held and exhibited at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.

This picture was included in the Exposition Universelle of 1867, and was bought from the artist in the same year by the Comte de Nieuwerkerque, Director of Museums, for Napoleon III, at the price of 2000 French francs. It was part of the Emperor's personal property, and was allotted to the Louvre by the Tribunal de la Seine, along with other paintings, on 12 February 1879. In 1881, it was exhibited in the Luxembourg, with the title Le puits noir (The Black Ravine), which is really the name of another work painted in 1869.[1]

The landscape is currently housed and exhibited at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, and represents a gorge, a ravine through which runs a winding stream, its bed littered with rocks, between steep walls covered with wild vegetation. The stream depicted is the Loue, a  capricious creek flowing through the village of Ornans, where Courbet was born. The artist seems to have returned to this spot several times: it can be recognised in a number of his paintings[2]


Of this landscape, Courbet wrote:
It is perhaps the best I have ever painted; it shows the Loue walled up between vast boulders of mossy rock, with thick sunlit foliage in the background.[3]
Courbet loved to seek out some unspoilt corner in these lonely gorges, where the damp atmosphere conveys the impression of a strange world from which the primordial waters have only just receded. In this work, in which one senses the enthusiasm of the artist, Courbet's technique is at its peak of perfection. He has only used the brush in the background shadows; elsewhere the painting has been done with the palette knife. Courbet crushes his pigments and spreads them diagonally with his knife, thus letting underlying wads of paint show through: this creates the effect of transparency and depth as rich as those obtained by means of glazes in the work of earlier artists. His splendid greens evoke the luxuriance of a semi-aquatic world where vegetation runs riot.[4]

Monographs on the art and life of Courbet have been written by Estignard (Paris, 1874), D'Ideville, (Paris, 1878), Silvestre in Les artistes français, (Paris, 1878), Isham in Van Dyke's Modern French Masters (New York, 1896), Meier-Graefe, Corot and Courbet, (Leipzig, 1905), Cazier (Paris, 1906), Riat, (Paris, 1906), Muther, (Berlin, 1906), Robin, (Paris, 1909), Benedite, (Paris, 1911) and Lazár Béla (Paris, 1911) (in French).

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3268045,"Luxe, Calme et Volupté is a 1904 oil painting by the French artist Henri Matisse. Both foundational in the oeuvre of Matisse and a pivotal work in the history of art, Luxe, Calme et Volupté is considered the starting point of Fauvism.[1] This painting is a dynamic and vibrant work created early on in his career as a painter.[2] It displays an evolution of the Neo-Impressionist style mixed with a new conceptual meaning based in fantasy and leisure that had not been seen in works before.[3]

Prior to the beginning of his Fauvist period Matisse had been formally educated in the arts and started his career copying works from old masters.[4] His first original works resembled those from his education.[4] After he left school, influence from Impressionism developed into his work and gradually led him to the Post-Impressionist movement where this style stuck with him until it evolved into Fauvism.[4] Matisse frequently purchased works from artists such as Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin during his time before Fauvism that influenced his painting and the development of his style over time.[4]

Luxe, Calme et Volupté was painted by Matisse in 1904, after a summer spent working in St. Tropez on the French Riviera alongside the Neo-Impressionist painters Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross.[5] Signac purchased the work, which was exhibited in 1905 at the Salon des Indépendants.[6]

The painting's title comes from the poem L'Invitation au voyage, from Charles Baudelaire's volume Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil):


Là, tout n'est qu'ordre et beauté,
Luxe, calme et volupté.

There, all is order and beauty,
Luxury, peace, and pleasure.[7]

The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac. Divisionism is created by individual dots of colors placed strategically on the canvas in order to appear blended from a distance; Matisse's variant of this style is created by numerous short dashes of color to develop the forms that are seen in the image.[8] He first adopted the style after reading Signac's essay ""D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme"" in 1898.[4]

The simplification of form and details is a trademark of Fauvist landscapes in which artists intentionally created artificial structures that distorted the reality of images.[9] Many of these same qualities can be found in Matisse's other works. Other Fauvist painters worked on large scale landscapes that did not focus as much on figures within the composition as with Matisse's works.[9]

Detail lower left

Scholars suggest that interpreting the paintings requires the viewer to acknowledge its resistance to interpretation.[10] Matisse's previous works were all firmly rooted in the visual aspects of Post-Impression leading scholars to question how his work had taken such a drastic turn into a depiction of fantasy.[3] David Carrier writes that the painting is ambiguous and lacks reference to any of its supposed sources of inspiration.[3] Despite the literary source for the work's title, Luxe, Calme, et Volupté, it is not related to the narrative of poem in any way.[3]

It was first exhibited under the title Portrait de M. W. S. at the Salon of 1865, where it was accepted along with Summer Evening (Soirée d'été), a painting now considered lost. It was likely commissioned from Renoir by his friend Alfred Sisley to help him with his financial difficulties. The painting portrays Sisley's father, William, a businessman born in France in 1799 to an English father. Portrait of William Sisley is currently held by the Musée d'Orsay.[1]

This early work shows the influence of Realism on Renoir, exemplified by artists like Gustave Courbet, as well as the Neoclassicism of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, a favorite of Renoir's.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q683274,"Bal du moulin de la Galette (commonly known as Dance at Le moulin de la Galette) is an 1876 painting by French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir.

It is housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and is one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.[1] The painting depicts a typical Sunday afternoon at the original Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre in Paris. In the late 19th century, working-class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the evening.[2]: 121–3  Like other works of Renoir's early maturity, Bal du moulin de la Galette is a typically Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering, sun-dappled light.

From 1879-94 the painting was in the collection of the French painter Gustave Caillebotte; when he died it became the property of the French Republic as payment for death duties. From 1896-1929 the painting hung in the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris. From 1929 it hung in the Louvre until it was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986.

Renoir painted a smaller version of the picture (78 × 114 cm) with the same title. The painting is now believed to be in a private collection in Switzerland. Apart from their size, the two paintings are virtually identical, although the smaller is painted in a more fluid manner than the d'Orsay version. One is presumably a copy of the original, but it is not known which is the original. It is not even known which was the one first exhibited at the Salon of 1877, because though it was catalogued and given favourable attention by critics, its entry did not indicate the size of the painting.[3]

For many years it was owned by John Hay Whitney. On May 17, 1990, his widow sold the painting for US$78 million at Sotheby's in New York City to Ryoei Saito (Saitō Ryōei), the honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, Japan.

At the time of sale, it was one of the top two most expensive artworks ever sold, together with van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which was also purchased by Saito. Saito caused international outrage when he suggested in 1991 that he intended to cremate both paintings with him when he died. However, when Saito and his companies ran into severe financial difficulties, bankers who held the painting as collateral for loans arranged a confidential sale through Sotheby's to an undisclosed buyer.[4] Although not known for certain, the painting is believed to be in the hands of a Swiss collector.[citation needed]

Renoir conceived his project of painting the dancing at Le Moulin de la Galette in May 1876 and its execution is described in full by his civil servant friend Georges Rivière in his memoir Renoir et ses amis.[2] Renoir needed to set up a studio near the mill. A suitable studio was found at an abandoned cottage in the rue Cortot with a garden described by Rivière as a ""beautiful abandoned park"".[2]: 130  Several of Renoir's major works were painted in this garden at this time, including La balançoire (The Swing). The gardens  and its buildings have been preserved as the Musée de Montmartre.

Rivière identified several of the personalities in the painting. Despite Renoir's habit of distributing a sought after fashionable hat of the time amongst his models (the straw bonnet with a wide red ribbon top right is an example of this hat, called a timbale), he was unable to persuade his favourite sixteen-year-old model Jeanne Samary, who appears in La balançoire, to pose  as principal for the painting (in fact she was conducting an affair with a local boy at the time). It is her sister Estelle who poses as the girl wearing a blue and pink striped dress. These two girls came to Le Moulin every Sunday with their family; with two younger sisters barely taller than the tables, and their mother and father, properly chaperoned by their mother (entry was free for girls at Le Moulin and not all were models of virtue). Beside her is a group consisting of Pierre-Franc Lamy and Norbert Goeneutte (also appearing in La balançoire), fellow painters, as well as Rivière himself. Behind her, amongst the dancers, are to be found Henri Gervex, Eugène Pierre Lestringuez and Paul Lhote (who appears in Dance in the Country). In the middle distance, at the centre of the dance hall, the Cuban painter Don Pedro Vidal de Solares y Cardenas is depicted in striped trousers, dancing with the model called Margot (Marguerite Legrand). Apparently, the exuberant Margot found Solares too reserved and was endeavouring to loosen him up by dancing polkas with him, and teaching him dubious songs in the local slang. She was to die of typhoid just two years later, Renoir nursing her until the end, paying both for her treatment and her funeral.[2]: 136–7 [3][5]

Rivière describes the painting as executed on the spot and not without difficulty, as the wind constantly threatened to blow the canvas away. This has led some critics to speculate that it was the larger d'Orsay painting that was painted here, as the smaller would have been easier to control. On the other hand, the smaller is much the more spontaneous and freely worked of the two, characteristic of en plein air work.[3]

It entered Morisot's own collection, possibly directly from the artist, before being donated to the French state in 1999. It was initially allocated to the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris, before being moved in 2000 to the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille, where it still hangs.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q544315,"The Astronomer (Dutch: De astronoom) is a painting finished in about 1668 by the Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer. It is in oil on canvas with dimensions 51 cm × 45 cm (20 in × 18 in).

Portrayals of scientists were a favourite topic in 17th-century Dutch painting[1] and Vermeer's oeuvre includes both this astronomer and the slightly later The Geographer. Both are believed to portray the same man,[2][3][4] possibly Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.[5] A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material, confirming their close relationship.[6]

The astronomer's profession is shown by the celestial globe (version by Jodocus Hondius) and the book on the table, the 1621 edition of Adriaan Metius's Institutiones Astronomicae Geographicae.[2][3][4][7] Symbolically, the volume is open to Book III, a section advising the astronomer to seek ""inspiration from God"" and the painting on the wall shows the Finding of Moses—Moses may represent knowledge and science (""learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians"").[8]

The provenance of The Astronomer can be traced back to 27 April 1713, when it was sold at the Rotterdam sale of an unknown collector (possibly Adriaen Paets [nl] or his father, of Rotterdam) together with The Geographer. The presumed buyer was Hendrik Sorgh, whose estate sale held in Amsterdam on 28 March 1720 included both The Astronomer and The Geographer, which were described as 'Een Astrologist: door Vermeer van Delft, extra puyk' ('An Astrologist by Vermeer of Delft, top-notch') and 'Een weerga, van ditto, niet minder' ('Similar by ditto, no less').

Between 1881 and 1888 it was sold by the Paris art dealer Léon Gauchez to the banker and art collector Alphonse James de Rothschild, after whose death it was inherited by his son, Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild. In 1940 it was seized from his hotel in Paris by the Nazi Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete[clarification needed] after the German invasion of France. A small swastika was stamped on the back in black ink. The painting was returned to the Rothschilds after the war, and was acquired by the French state as giving in payment of inheritance taxes in 1983[9][10] and then exhibited at the Louvre since 1983.[10][11][12]

The work was first recorded in 1942 in an antiques shop in Toulouse, at which time it was attributed to Lorenzo Costa. Three years later it was acquired by France's Réunion des Musées Nationaux as a work by an anonymous French artist, reattributed to Perréal and assigned to the Musée de Moulins.[2]

In 1963 Charles Sterling researched the work, removing the attribution to Perréal and instead assigned it to the Emilian Renaissance. He was also the first to link it back to Porcia (then thought to be a Saint Agnes or Virgin of the Annunciation from the circle of Lorenzo di Credi or of Franciabigio), which Sterling happened to have seen at the Istituto Centrale del Restauro in Rome. 

Minerva was reassigned yet again to a Florentine painter in 1967, the same year as it was moved to the Louvre's stores. It formed part of an exhibition in 1982, for which Sylvie Béguin reattributed it to Fra Bartolomeo's youth. However, it to took until its inclusion in the Il Giardino di San Marco exhibition in 1992 for this attribution to be definitively confirmed.

The goddess Minerva appears in a niche, showing her attributes, the helmet, the classical armor, the spear and the shield decorated with the  Medusa, as well as the sword tied to her belt. The painting was believed to be part of a series dedicated to illustrious women, perhaps destined to decorate a room of a private palace.

The figure takes a step forward, towards the viewer, coming out of the niche. The composition is very balanced, with an accentuated sense of the volume of the figure, obtained through glazes and chromatic combinations of great finesse, referable to the painter's early youthful phase.[3]

The painting was bought in 1898 by Wilhelm von Bode, from a collection in Padua belonging to the estate of the Giustiniani and Barbarigo families.

The work merges the style of Ingres' teacher Jacques-Louis David with that of the troubador style.[1] The scene is marked by ambient light, sumptuous objects and rich colours.[2]

In 1851, M. de Guisard, the state's Director of Fine Arts, gave Ingres a commission of 20,000 francs for a painting of a subject of Ingres's choosing.[3][2] Ingres offered instead to fulfill the commission by finishing two paintings already in progress, Joan of Arc and a Virgin with a Host.[3] Both were subjects he had depicted in earlier works: he had made a wash drawing of Joan of Arc as a model for an engraving by Pollet that was published in the 1840s in La Plutarque français, Vies des hommes et femmes illustres de la France by E. Mannechet.[3] The drawing shows her in a pose similar to that of the later painting, dressed in armor and resting her hand on an altar, but with no accompanying figures.[3]

For the painting Ingres made new preparatory drawings using a nude model. He then made drawings in which he added the clothes and armour.[4] The final composition shows Joan at the coronation of Charles VII of France in Reims Cathedral, victorious and looking up to heaven, which she felt had given France the victory. To her right are three pages, the monk Jean Paquerel, and a servant. The servant is a self-portrait of the artist.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23898,"Triptych of the Sedano family is an oil-on-panel triptych altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Gerard David, usually dated between 1490 and 1498, probably c. 1495. It is noted for its innovative framing and for its rendering of the decorative oriental carpet seen at Mary's feet.

The triptych was purchased by the Louvre in 1890.

The work was commissioned by the Castilian merchant Jean de Sedano, and features the Virgin and child in an enclosed garden. Each wing shows a donor kneeling in prayer accompanied by a saint: John the Baptist is seen to the left, John the Evangelist to the right. The panels are unified by the continuous background landscape of green fields and a serene, deep blue seascape. When the wings are closed, the exterior shows Adam and Eve, thereby creating a contrast between the heavenly interior and sinful exterior.

Art historian Maryan Ainsworth notes that the triptych's dense imagery appears to be ""a conflation of features of some of the most notable Netherlandish art of the last sixty years"", indicating that it was created in response to the high demand across Europe at the time for Netherlandish triptychs.[1] Specifically, the figures are painted in a manner similar to Jan van Eyck's work, particularly Adam and Eve,[2] while the overall design and composition seem derived from Hans Memling. Maryan Ainsworth of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, sees this as a conscious decision of the artist to align and identify himself as on a par with the masters of Netherlandish art.[3]

In 1503, de Sedano joined the Confraternity of the Holy Blood, a sect devoted to the veneration of a 12th-century relic brought from Jerusalem. The donor appears kneeling in prayer in the left wing, being blessed by John the Baptist, with his young son by his side.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q38395329,"Luigia Cattaneo-Gentile, also known as A Noblewoman from Genoa is a portrait painting by the Flemish Baroque painter Anthony van Dyck. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 200.[2]

The portrait was most likely painted in 1622, during Van Dyck's lengthy stay in Genoa, where he became the official portraitist of the members of the Genoese aristocracy. Luigia Cattaneo-Gentile was bought from the Durazzo family by Wilhelm von Bode in 1890 and was long thought to represent a marchesa from the House of Durazzo. The identification with the House of Cattaneo-Gentile instead, while already hypothesized in 1890, was only confirmed in 1986 by the Van Dyck specialist, Susan J. Barnes.[1]

From 1929 to 1965, the painting was attributed to Peter Paul Rubens, which was testament to its superior pictorial qualities, until the Rubens specialist Justus Müller-Hofstede determined that it was definitely an early masterpiece by a young Anthony van Dyck.[1][2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16649045,"Portrait of Madame Duvaucey is an 1807 oil on canvas painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It shows Antonia Duvauçey of Nittis, the lover of  Charles-Jean-Marie Alquier, then ambassador to the Holy See. Duvaucey is positioned in a flat pictorial space, gazing frontally at the viewer, dressed in lavish clothing and accessories. The portrait is the first female portrait painted during the artist's stay in Rome.[1] Portrait of Madame Duvaucey is acclaimed for exhibiting her enigmatic charm, and as ""not a portrait that gives pleasure..[but]...a portrait that gives rise to dreams"".[2]

Duvaucey stares out directly at the viewer with a sly and suggestive smile. Set against a flat grey background, the perspective of the portrait is very shallow overall. It is framed by the inwards swoops of the cured rose and gold Louis XVI chair, and embroidered pale yellow and red silk shawl. She holds an expensive looking fan, and is adorned with three partly visible rings, an elegant thin necklace and elephant hair bracelets.[1]

Typical of Ingres' female portraits, her anatomy seems almost boneless. Her arms are out of proportion, with her left arm, at the viewer's right, far longer than her right. Her neck is too elongated and doesn't seem strong enough to support her head. In a prelude to his later ""Odalisque"" paintings, her facial features seem almost arabesque.[1] The contemporary critic Théophile Gautier wrote of her that ""there is no woman that M. Ingres has painted, but the likeness of the ancient Chimera, in Empire dress.[3]

Ingres was paid 500 francs for the commission. It was exhibited at the 1833 Salon and again in 1855,[4] and while one critic complained of its ""dry, shadow-less quality, and..the defective anatomy"",[1] the painting was a huge success - his most acclaimed at the 1833 Salon- and drew critical and popular admiration. Ingres was widely praised, especially for his skill with line and his ""religion of form"".[3] It is today seen as groundbreaking in the development of portraiture.[5]

Forty years after its completion, Duvaucey was in urgent need of money, and visited Ingres in Paris to sell the painting. Ingres recognised her, and found a buyer in Fredric Reisit, whose collection became the Musée Condé, Chantilly where the painting remains today.[1]

The work resulted of an order made by Antonin Proust to Manet to create four paintings on the theme of the Four Seasons, but the painter only had time to make two, this one and Spring, before dying.

The model Méry Laurent wears a fur coat and appears in profile, in a similar way to the portraits of the Italian Renaissance. Placed in front of a Japanese fabric, the blue of it and the brown of her clothing brings out the pink of her complexion.

The model herself bought this work by 1550 francs in 1884, after the artist's death; this one bequeaths the painting to the Museum of Fine Arts in Nancy, her birthplace, making this painting the first by Manet to enter a provincial museum.[2]

Joseph drills a piece of wood with an auger.[2] The shape of the auger reflects the shape of the Cross and the geometry of the wood arrayed on the floor, set cross-wise to the seated child Christ, is a foreshadowing of the crucifixion.[4] John Rupert Martin writes that Jesus' patience represents ""filial obedience and the acceptance of his destiny as martyr"".[4]

This painting, created ca. 1642,[1] is one of several tenebrist paintings by La Tour. Others include The Education of the Virgin, the Penitent Magdalene, and The Dream of Saint Joseph. In all these works, a single, strong light source is a central element, surrounded by cast shadows.

The Marly Horses are two 1743–1745 Carrara marble sculpted groups by Guillaume Coustou, showing two rearing horses with their groom. They were commissioned by Louis XV of France for the trough at the entrance to the grounds of his château de Marly. Coustou's last works, they were intended to replace two other sculpted groups, Mercury on Pegasus and Pegasus, Renown of Horses, both by Antoine Coysevox, which had been removed to the Tuileries Gardens in 1719.[1]

Louis XV chose the modellos in 1743 and the full-size sculptures were completed in only two years, being installed at Marly in 1745. They proved highly successful in reproduction, particularly on a smaller scale, and prefigured Théodore Géricault and other Romantic artists' obsession with equestrian subjects. The Marly horses were later also used as the central motif of the monochrome 819-line RTF/ORTF test card[2] which was used on TF1 from 1953 until 1983.[3]

The originals were moved to the place de la Concorde in Paris in 1794 and Louis-Denis Caillouette (1790–1868) restored them in 1840. In 1984 it was concluded that the annual military parades on 14 July were damaging the sculptures and they were replaced by marble copies produced by Michel Bourbon in the studio of a subsidiary of Bouygues. The latter also gained the right to an extra copy, which was placed in Bouygues's social building. The original sculptures were moved to a former courtyard in the Richelieu wing of the Louvre Museum, which was renamed the 'cour Marly' in their honour, whilst Bourbon's two main copies were moved to the originals' first site near the trough at Marly, with work overseen by the architect Serge Macel.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3937485,"Charles I at the Hunt – also known under its French title, Le Roi à la chasse – is an oil-on-canvas portrait of Charles I of England by Anthony van Dyck c. 1635, now in the Louvre Museum, Paris. It depicts Charles in civilian clothing and standing next to a horse as if resting on a hunt, in a manner described by the Louvre as a ""subtle compromise between gentlemanly nonchalance and regal assurance"".[1]

Van Dyck gives his naturalistic style full expression: ""Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King"".[2] The 105 centimetres (41 in) by 76 centimetres (30 in) painting depicts Charles in lighter colours to the left of the painting, standing against the darker ground and the shadowed servants and horse under a tree to the right; his dark hat prevents his face from appearing washed out by the sky. 

Charles is dismounted, and stands as if surveying his domain and the sea beyond (perhaps the Solent with the Isle of Wight visible in the distance). His head is turned and his face pinched in a disdainful and somewhat bitter smile. The king was famously sensitive about his height, and the painting compensates by placing the viewer at a low angle point of view, looking up at the king. Latin inscription on a rock in the lower right corner establishes his rights as a king; ""Carolus.I.REX Magnae Britanniae"" (Charles I, King of Great Britain – a political statement at the time, only 32 years after his father James had united the crowns of Scotland and England, and proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, and nearly 70 years before the Acts of Union legally created the Kingdom of Great Britain).

Charles is dressed as an aristocratic gentleman in a wide-brimmed cavalier hat, teardrop earring, shimmering silver satin doublet, red breeches, and turned-down leather boots, apparently resting during a day of hunting.  He is girt with a sword, with one hand resting nonchalantly on a walking stick; the other rests on his hip, holding his gloves as a sign of his sovereignty and assurance.  The painting also shows a young page and Charles' picture-buying agent and favoured courtier, Endymion Porter, who is holding the horse. The horse seemingly bows its head in submission to the king.  

In his three years as Principal Painter in Ordinary, Van Dyck had already made two other equestrian portraits of Charles in armour: Charles I with M. de St Antoine depicting Charles accompanied by his riding master, Pierre Antoine Bourdon, Seigneur de St Antoine; and Equestrian Portrait of Charles I depicting Charles as a heroic philosopher king, contemplatively surveying his domain.  

Charles paid van Dyck £100 for the painting in 1638 – although the artist originally requested £200 – but it is not mentioned in the inventory of his collections after his execution.  It was in France by 1738, and the Comtesse du Barry sold the painting to Louis XVI of France in 1775.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23915,"An Old Man and his Grandson (Italian: Ritratto di vecchio con nipote) is a ca. 1490 tempera painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Domenico Ghirlandaio. One of Ghirlandaio's best-known works, it is considered notable for its emotional poignancy. Its realism has been described as unique among the portraits of the Quattrocento.[1]

The picture portrays an older man in a red robe, embracing a young child who is also wearing red. They sit in an interior, illuminated against a darkened wall. Behind them at right is a window through which can be seen a generalized landscape, its uneven terrain and winding roads typical of Ghirlandaio's backgrounds.[2] Although the man's fur-lined robe and cappuccio and the boy's elegant doublet and cap indicate a noble heritage,[3] and despite the traditional assumption that the subjects are grandfather and grandson, their identities are unknown.[2] It is possible that the painting was commemorative in purpose, and that the child was a narrative invention intended to emphasize the man's beneficence.[4] The poignancy of the image is dramatized by the contrast between the man's weathered and wise face, and the child's delicate profile. While the composition is thematically related to portraiture from the Netherlands, by the mid-15th century the motif of a portrait in an interior with a landscape seen in the distance was common in Italy.[1][4]

An extraordinary feature of the painting is the deformity of the man's nose, evidence of rhinophyma. Ghirlandaio has presented the portrait in a naturalistic and sympathetic fashion, at variance with physiognomic theory of the era, which maintained a connection between external appearances and internal truths.[1][2] Rather than implying a defect of character, An Old Man and his Grandson invites appreciation of the man's virtuousness.[1] The painting depicts a moment of intimacy between an old man and a child, underscored by the placement of the child's hand on the man's chest, and the man's gentle expression. This show of affection endows the picture with emotional qualities beyond those expected from a traditional dynastic portrait.[5] In the words of art historian Bernard Berenson, ""There is no more human picture in the entire range of Quattrocento painting, whether in or out of Italy.""[6]

The painting's provenance is uncertain until 1880, when it entered the Louvre, and then only after it was rejected by the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin out of concern for its condition.[2] Several commentators in the late nineteenth century reported that the picture had been abraded by overcleaning, and there were disfiguring scratches on the man's face.[2] In 1996 the scratches and areas of discolored inpainting were removed, and the painting was cleaned and retouched.[2]

A drawing by Ghirlandaio entitled Head of an Old Man, once owned by Giorgio Vasari, portrays the same man as in the painting. The drawing may have been made while the sitter was asleep, or after his death, in which case it would have served as a graphic death mask.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24249,"The Madonna of the Rabbit (French: Vierge au lapin) is an oil painting by Titian, dated to 1530 and now held in the Louvre in Paris. It is signed ""Ticianus f."" and is named after the white rabbit held in Mary's left hand. The rabbit is a symbol of fertility and – due to its whiteness – of Mary's purity and the mystery of the Incarnation, and is also a symbol of her virginity; female rabbits and hares can conceive a second litter of offspring while still pregnant with the first, resulting in them being able to give birth seemingly without having been impregnated.[1]

Records show that Federico Gonzaga commissioned three paintings from Titian in 1529. One of these can, with some security, be identified with the Madonna of the Rabbit. The painting's small format shows that it was intended for private devotion. The painting also contains echoes of the artist's personal circumstances at the time; on 6 August 1530 his wife Cecilia died giving birth to their third child, Lavinia, who was then entrusted to Titian's sister Orsa (just as the Christ Child in the painting is entrusted into another woman's hands, in this case Catherine of Alexandria). He was mourning and melancholic until at least October that year, as is shown in the letters sent to Mantua by the ambassador Benedetto Agnello. 

The work was acquired with the rest of the Gonzaga collection in 1627 by Charles I of England and on his execution sold at auction. It was acquired in 1665 by Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIV of France.

Catherine is dressed as a maid of honour and is shown with her traditional attribute of a broken wheel at her feet. She and Mary are sitting in a meadow beside a fruit basket which contains apples representing original sin and grapes representing the Eucharist and the redemption of sins. In the background a shepherd looks on – a motif drawn from Giorgione and perhaps intended as a portrait of Federico Gonzaga, since an X-ray shows that the initial composition had Mary turning her eyes towards the shepherd, or of the artist, since the shepherd appears sad and aloof like the mourning Titian. 

In the foreground, the wildflowers evoke the idyllic locus amoenus in classical poetry and the Arcadian landscape, which is also found in works like the Pastoral Concert or the Baccanali series of Ferrara. The sensitive landscape painting is also notable, with orange stripes over a blue twilit sky, typical of Titian's highly mature phase.

It does not appear in the 1683 Charles Le Brun inventory of Louis XIV's collections, but was acquired by the latter sometime before the compilation of the 1709 inventory by Jacques Bailly.[3] It had been expanded at the top and bottom by 1709, probably in the late 17th century.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3910090,"The Sermon of Saint Stephen  is an oil-on-canvas by Italian artist of the Venetian school Vittore Carpaccio, painted in 1514. It is now in the Louvre in Paris.

This painting was one of five scenes representing the life of Saint Stephen, painted between 1511 and 1514 for the Scuola dei Lanieri, Santo Stefano (Venice).[1] The series was broken up in 1806, when the religious houses were suppressed.[2] Two panels went to the Brera Gallery, Milan; in 1812, Vivant Denon exchanged some of the northern paintings in the Louvre for Italian works in the Brera, and one of these panels was transferred under this arrangement. Another is in Berlin; one has disappeared, and the fifth is in Stuttgart.[3]

The Sermon of Saint Stephen the deacon, represented in this Louvre painting, took place in Jerusalem. This gave Carpaccio an excuse for filling his canvas with picturesque oriental costumes and architecture. Jerusalem in the early days of Christianity is here identified as Constantinople (actually Yoros Castle on the opposite side of the Bosphorus ) - a fantastic and imaginary[citation needed] Constantinople full of Turkish, antique, Byzantine and Italian elements. Carpaccio refers with pride, in a letter to the Marquis of Mantua, to a view of Jerusalem which he had painted.[4]

Its date of execution is unknown. The painting is kept in the Louvre in Paris.[2][1][3][4]

The painting is in de Momper's typical style, and showcases the less realistic and more imaginary landscape art of his circle. Many Flemish landscapists painted in a more imaginary and apparently old-fashioned style to please the commissioners, as those kind of paintings sold for much higher prices.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2027662,"The Turkish Bath (Le Bain turc) is an oil painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, initially completed between 1852 and 1859, but modified in 1862.[1] The painting depicts a group of nude women at a pool in a harem.[1] It has an erotic style that evokes both the Near East and earlier western styles associated with mythological subject matter. The painting expands on a number of motifs that Ingres had explored in earlier paintings,[1] in particular The Valpinçon Bather (1808) and La Grande odalisque (1814).

The work is signed and dated 1862, when Ingres was around 82 years old.[2] He altered the original rectangular format and changed the painting to a tondo. A photograph of its original state, taken by Charles Marville, survives.[3]

The painting is known for its subtle colourisation, especially the very pale skin of the women resting in the privacy of a bathing area. The figures are given an almost abstract and ""slender and sinuous"" form,[citation needed] and seem at times to lack skeleton. They are arranged in a very harmonious, circular manner, a curved  arrangement that heightens the eroticism of the painting. Its charge is in part achieved through the use of motifs that include the implied haze of Oriental perfume, and the inclusion of vases, running water, fruit and jewels, as well as a palette that ranges from pale white to pink, ivory, light greys and a variety of browns.[4]

Ingres relished the irony of producing an erotic work in his old age, painting an inscription of his age (AETATIS LXXXII, ""at age 82"") on the work—in 1867 he told others that he still retained ""all the fire of a man of thirty years"".[5][6] He did not paint this work from live models, but from croquis and several of his earlier paintings, reusing ""bather"" and ""odalisque"" figures he had drawn or painted as single figures on beds or beside a bath.

The figure from The Valpinçon Bather appears almost identically as the central element of the later composition, but now plays a mandolin. The woman in the background with her arm extended and holding a cup resembles the sitter in his portrait of Madame Moitessier (1856). The face of the woman with her arms raised above her head in the near right is similar to a croquis (1818) of the artist's wife, Delphine Ramel,[3] though her right shoulder is lowered while her right arm is raised. The other bodies are juxtaposed in various unlit areas behind them.

Ingres drew from a wide variety of painterly sources, including 19th-century academic art, Neoclassicism and late Mannerism.[citation needed] The colourisation is one of ""chastising coolness"", while figures merge into each other in a manner that evokes sexuality, but ultimately is intended to show Ingres's skill at defying rational perspective.[3]

Ingres was influenced by the contemporary fashion for Orientalism, relaunched by Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. On leaving for Italy in 1806, he copied in his notebooks a text extolling ""the baths of the seraglio of Mohammed"", in which can be read a description of a harem where one ""goes into a room surrounded by sofas [...] and it is there that many women destined for this use attend the sultana in the bath, wiping her handsome body and rubbing the softest perfumes into her skin; it is there that she must then take a voluptuous rest"".[5][7]

In 1825, he copied a passage from Letters from the Orient by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who had accompanied her British diplomat husband to the Ottoman Empire in 1716. Her letters had been re-published eight times in France alone between 1763 and 1857,[citation needed] adding to the Orientalist craze. The passage Ingres copied was entitled ""Description of the women's bath at Adrianople"" and reads: ""I believe there were two hundred women there in all. Beautiful naked women in various poses... some conversing, others at their work, others drinking coffee or tasting a sorbet, and many stretched out nonchalantly, whilst their slaves (generally ravishing girls of 17 or 18 years) plaited their hair in fantastical shapes.""[5][8] The environment of The Turkish Bath, however, bears little resemblance to the public bathing described by Lady Montagu.[9]

In contrast to Eugène Delacroix, who visited an Algerian harem, Ingres never travelled to Africa or the Middle East, and the courtesans shown are more Caucasian and European than Middle Eastern or African in appearance.[10] For Ingres the oriental theme was above all a pretext for portraying the female nude in a passive and sexual context. Exotic elements are few and far between in the image: musical instruments, a censer and a few ornaments.

The painter's first buyer was a relation of Napoleon III, but he handed it back some days later, his wife having found it ""unsuitable"" (""peu convenable"").[5] It was purchased in 1865 by Khalil Bey, a former Turkish diplomat who added it to his collection of erotic paintings.[11]

Edgar Degas demanded that The Turkish Bath be shown at the Exposition Universelle (1855), in the wake of which came contrasting reactions: Paul Claudel, for example, compared it to a ""cake full of maggots"".[5] At the start of the 20th century, patrons wished to offer The Turkish Bath to the Louvre, but the museum's council refused it twice.[12] After the national collections of Munich offered to buy it, the Louvre finally accepted it in 1911,[12] thanks to a gift by the Société des amis du Louvre, to whom the patron Maurice Fenaille made a three-year interest-free loan of 150,000 Francs for the purpose.[citation needed]

The tomb of Philippe Pot is a life-sized funerary monument commissioned by the military leader and diplomat Philippe Pot for his burial at the chapel of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Cîteaux Abbey, Dijon, France. His effigy shows him recumbent on a slab, his hands raised in prayer, and wearing armour and a heraldic tunic. The eight mourners (pleurants) are dressed in black hoods, and act as pallbearers carrying him towards his grave. Pot commissioned the tomb when he was around 52 years old, some 13 years before his death in 1493. The detailed inscriptions written on the sides of the slab emphasise his achievements and social standing.

Pot was a godson of Philip the Good and became a knight of the Golden Fleece. He served under two of the last Valois Dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Good and Charles the Bold. After the latter's defeat by René II, Duke of Lorraine, at the battle of Nancy in 1477, Pot switched allegiance to the French king, Louis XI, who eventually appointed him grand seneschal of Burgundy. He later served under Louis' son Charles VIII.

The tomb is made of limestone, paint, gold and lead. It is recorded as having been completed in 1480 but there is no mention of its designers or craftsmen. Art historians generally cite Antoine Le Moiturier as the most likely designer of the pleurants, based on circumstantial evidence including similarities to other of his known works.[3] The monument was stolen during the French Revolution, and after changing hands several times was placed in a private garden in Dijon in the 19th century. Since 1899 it has been in the collection of the Musée du Louvre, where it is on permanent display. The tomb underwent a major restoration between 2016 and 2018.

Philippe Pot was born in 1428 at the Château de la Rochepot, outside Dijon in today's France. The region was then part of the Duchy of Burgundy and his father, Jacques, was an adviser and senior official to Duke Philip the Good.[4][5] Pot was raised and educated at the Burgundian court. He was a scholar and bibliophile,[4] and served during the politically fraught years of the last two Valois dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Good (r. 1419–1467) and Charles the Bold (r. 1467–1477). During this period, he rose to become a knight of the Golden Fleece and seigneur, or lord, of La Rochepot (his ancestral home) and Thorey-sur-Ouche in Burgundy.[4] He was instrumental in arranging both Charles' betrothal to Catherine of France, and second marriage to Isabella of Bourbon.[6]

Soon after Charles' defeat and death in January 1477 at the battle of Nancy, Burgundy came under French control, and Pot seemingly changed allegiance to Louis XI, king of France (r. 1461–1483). Suspicious of his association with Louis, Charles and Isabella's daughter Mary of Burgundy expelled him from her realm and the court at Lille in June 1477. In disgrace, he fled to the then French city of Tournai, and was removed from the order of the Golden Fleece in 1481.[4]

He travelled in August 1477 on behalf of Louis to Lens in northern France to negotiate a truce with Mary and her husband and co-ruler, Maximilian of Austria. The truce was signed on 8 September, and Louis eventually appointed him as grand seneschal of Burgundy. Following the king's death in 1483, Pot served under Louis' son Charles VIII (r. 1483–1498).[4][7] Pot died in Dijon on 20 September 1493 aged around 65, having already made detailed plans for his burial place, funeral monument and epitaph.[8][9]

Plans for Pot's tomb first appear in the historical records on 28 August 1480, when Pot paid the abbot of Cîteaux Abbey, Jean de Cirey, one thousand livres for a burial place in the abbey's chapel of Saint-Jean-Baptiste. Although the dates of its construction are unknown, it is generally assumed to have been between 1480 and 1483 given that the inscriptions mention events after the January 1477 death of Charles the Bold, and mention Louis XI as king.[9] Pot's motto ""Tant L. vaut, était"" (So much was he worth) was painted in several locations within the chapel.[9][10] The floor of the Jean-Baptiste chapel is lined with rows of medieval burial plots, although few are marked. It was placed at the corner of the south arm of the chapel's transept. He was buried underneath his monument, located to the left of the altar.[9]

Pot's monument was one of the last of the Burgundian-style tombs, whose characteristics include the deceased having naturalised faces, open eyes and angels above their heads.[2] The portrayal of the mourners (pleurants) is their defining motif. The style began with the tomb of Philip the Bold (d. 1404), built by the sculptors Jean de Marville (d. 1389) and Claus Sluter (d. 1405/6) from 1381, for the Chartreuse de Champmol, outside Dijon.[11][12] Described by the art historian Frits Scholten as ""one of the most magnificent tombs of the Late Middle Ages"",[12] its innovation was in transforming the mourners from the earlier static and unemotional figures to, according to the art historian John Moffitt, individualised weepers that ""stumble forward in mutual anguish while praying in perpetuity for the late Duke's soul"".[13] This treatment was often copied and developed over the following century.[14][15] By the time of Pot's commission the figures had become much larger – Sluter's have an average height of 40 cm (16 in) – and were free-standing rather than attached to the monument.[13][16]

Pot commissioned his tomb some 13 years before he died, with his date of death left blank during construction; the current one was probably added in the 19th century.[9] The tomb's extensive inscriptions indicate he wished to leave a record of his importance and prosperity, and to explain his change in allegiance to Louis XI. He probably first employed a painter to agree an overall design and then hired stonemasons, sculptors and craftsmen to construct the tomb.[17]

The monument is made of limestone.[1] Pot's effigy is carved in the round so it can be seen from all sides.[18] His skin is painted in vermilion and lead white.[19] His body rests on a slab, and his head is nested within a stone cushion. He is dressed in a tunic, silver armour decorated with a gilded breastplate, and a knight's helmet.[20] Pot's eyes are open and his hands are clasped in prayer. A sword lies to his side and his feet rest on a brown animal of uncertain species;[21] as a result of unsympathetic restoration before the era of photography of the animal and feet, art historians disagree whether the animal is a lion or a dog, and there are conflicting interpretations as to its iconography.[20] Most see it as a dog – a traditional symbol of fidelity in Burgundian tomb art.[22][23]

The coats of arms on his shield and on those of the mourners are painted in a variety of colours including gold, white, red, blue and black.[19] They represent the insignia of his ancestral families of Pot, Courtiamble, Anguissola, Blaisy, Guénant, Nesles and Montagu. The effigy does not contain the angels often found in contemporary northern European tombs, guiding the deceased to the afterlife.[20]

The eight mourners carrying Pot's slab were carved from limestone that was then polychromed, with four shades of black paint for their robes and hoods.[1][24][25] Their rigid forms and austere poses give the impression of the slow movement of a funeral procession.[21] They range in height from 134 cm (53 in) to 144 cm (57 in),[26] slightly less than life-sized, allowing the recumbent figure to align with the viewer's line of sight.[21] The full weight of the stone slab is supported by a narrow point on a shoulder of each figure, a feat described by Jugie, as ""masterful...in its technical audacity"".[7]

The mourners wear full-length black cloaks and shoulder-length hoods that mostly cover their faces.[21] The hoods identify them as laity participating in a ceremonial burial rite often held in the region from the 13th to the 16th century.[27] Although mourners with black hoods were not common in contemporary sculpture or painting, they can be found on works such as the mid-15th century ""Office of the Dead"" miniature from Jean Fouquet's illuminated manuscript the ""Hours of Étienne Chevalier"".[28]

Each bears a painted and gilded heraldic shield that refers to specific members of Pot's lineage, indicating the monument is of the ""kinship tomb"" type.[29] The four shields on the left represent the heraldries of Guillaume III Pot (d. c. 1390) and Raguenonde Guénant, the Cortiambles family, the Anguissola family, and the de Blaisy family. Those on the left represent the de Montagus and de Nesles, and two unidentified families.[30]

Although their faces are mostly covered and thus do not have individualised features, the mourners have different poses, heraldic shields and folded drapes.[21][31] The clothing contains deep, angular folds, and seems influenced by the works of the mid-15th century Early Netherlandish painters such as Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464). Other potential influences include the relief of four monks with covered heads on a short side of the tomb of Pierre de Bauffremont (d. 1472), commissioned in 1453 for his planned burial in Dijon,[32] and a near-contemporary tomb in Semur-en-Auxois that was likely known to Philippe.[33]

The extensive carved inscriptions on the edges of the slab are in Gothic script.[35] They are written in three rows, each beginning on the right side of the head of the effigy and ending behind his head on the opposite side. The text outlines his career with Philip the Good and Charles the Bold, as well as his reasons for switching sides to serve under Louis XI and Charles VIII following the Burgundian's 1477 defeat at Nancy.[35] Most of the text was written before Pot's death. His year of death is erroneously recorded as l'an mil ccccxci[v] (""in the year 149[4]"").[36][37]

Art historians have not identified the artists or craftsmen responsible for designing and building the tomb. Antoine Le Moiturier (d. 1495) is often suggested as likely to have designed the pleurants, given the similarity of the solid and rigid rendering of their clothing to the Mourners of Dijon which are often attributed to him.[38][39] Guillaume Chandelier, a painter active in Dijon at the time, has been suggested as involved, although with little supporting evidence.[40][2]

Art historians generally distinguish between the conventional design of the effigy, the expressive form of the mourners, and the inventive placing of the slab on narrow points above each of their shoulders.[17][41] While it is possible that a single artist, who was both a painter and sculptor, oversaw the tomb's completion, the variation in the quality of sculpture indicates several hands. The art historian Robert Marcoux notes variabilities in skill, and believes that parts of the sculpture are so sparsely detailed that they were likely completed by workshop members.[42]

The tomb passed through several owners and locations over the centuries, and its complex history was only fully pieced together in the mid-20th century.[5] It was first mentioned as completed in 1649 by Pierre Palliot, a bookseller and printer in Dijon, when he described the coats of arms and the inscriptions. The antiquarian and collector François Roger de Gaignières (d. 1715) made drawings of the tomb between 1699 and 1700, which are lost and known only from copies by the artist Louis Boudan (fl. 1687–1709); these are uninformative as they contain inaccuracies.[44] The tomb was nationalised during the early years of the French Revolution when the state took ownership of all church property.[5]

Sometime between 1791 and 1793 François Devosge, an artist and director of the Dijon School of Drawing, was employed to relocate it to the Benedictine abbey in Saint-Bénigne. It was next mentioned in September 1808 when it was acquired for fifty-three livres by Count Richard de Vesvrotte, following a legal case against the French state. He placed it under trees in the garden of his hôtel particulier (townhouse), the Hôtel de Ruffey at 33 rue Berbisey in Dijon.[45][46]

Richard's son Pierre sold the townhouse in 1850 and relocated the tomb to the Château de Vesvrotte in Beire-le-Châtel, Côte-d'Or,[48] where it was again placed in an outdoor garden. It was photographed for the first time in a series of photolithographs commissioned by Pierre's son Alphonse Richard de Vesvrotte. They were published in 1863, and inspired the artist, antiquarian and collector Charles Édouard de Beaumont's 1875 painting Au solei (or At the Tomb of Philippe Pot), which shows a couple lying at the foot of the tomb in a meadow surrounded by trees.[46][49][50]

The Vesvrotte family attempted to sell the tomb some time after Richard's death in 1873. The French state sought to block the sale, claiming it was by now public property, a claim eventually rejected in 1886 by a Dijon court who gave full ownership to Pierre's son, Armand de Vesvrotte.[43][50] It was nationalised by the French state that August on the grounds that it was an ""object of national historical importance"".[1] It was acquired for the Louvre in 1889 by the intermediator Charles Mannheim.[5][46]

The tomb was cleaned and restored several times in the 19th century, as evidenced by comparison to earlier reproductions, such as an engraving that shows Pot's fingers as being badly damaged.[46] Early drawings show his feet and the  animal in very poor condition until c. 1816. Some of the letters and words on the inscription were restored before 1880 by the archivist Jean-Baptiste Peincedé.[1] The tomb underwent a major restoration between 2018 and 2019 in a project led by Sophie Jugie, director of the Department of Sculptures at the Louvre.[7] It had been in poor condition, covered by accumulated layers of brown dirt around the heraldry, and had layers of gloss and polyvinyl alcohol from earlier cleanings. The restoration was preceded by an in-depth technical analysis conducted between 2016 and 2017 by the Centre for Research and Restoration of Museums of France. Surface layers of bleach, gloss and brown fouling of the blazons were taken off, the unpainted stone was cleaned, and additions from earlier restorations were removed.[51]

The monument had a significant influence on later funerary tombs. It transformed the conventional size and placement of pleurants, which previously had mostly been relatively small figures standing in niches. The motif of eight mourners carrying an effigy's slab can be seen on the tombs of Louis de Savoisy (d. 1515) and Jacques de Mâlain (d. 1527).[27][52] The tomb was photographed several times in the mid-19th century before it was acquired by the Louvre,[45] It was portrayed in 2010 by the American sculptor Matthew Day Jackson in a wood and plastic installation showing astronauts carrying a glass box containing a human skeleton.[53][54]

The painting depicts a rare event in the Spanish bullfight, when the bull manages to attack and bring down the horse. Admired and backed by Charles Baudelaire[2][3] and Émile Zola,[4] the work was so strongly attacked by other art critics that Manet kept it in his studio until 1872, when the Frères Goncourt praised it.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1198912,"Saint Jerome in His Study (German: Der heilige Hieronymus im Gehäus) is a copper engraving of 1514 by the German artist Albrecht Dürer. Saint Jerome is shown sitting behind his desk, engrossed in work. The table, on the corner of which is a cross, is typical of the Renaissance. An imaginary line from Jerome's head passing through the cross would arrive at the skull on the window ledge, as if contrasting death and the Resurrection. The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional iconography of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in Dürer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the Golden Legend (c. 1260), which contained fanciful hagiographies of saints.

St. Jerome in His Study is often considered as part of a group of three Dürer engravings (his Meisterstiche), the other two being the well-known Melencolia I (1514) and  Knight, Death and the Devil (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times: Knight, Death, and the Devil belongs to the moral sphere and the ""active life""; Melencolia I represents the intellectual; and St. Jerome the theological and contemplative life.

The composition is intimate, but the viewer has difficulty locating himself in relation to the picture's space. Thomas Puttfarken suggests that while the scene is very close to the observer, Dürer did not intend the viewer to feel present: ""the intimacy is not ours, but the saint's as he is engrossed in study and meditation"" (94).  Art historian Erwin Panofsky comments on the perspective:

The position of the sight point, quite far off centre, strengthens the impression of a representation determined not by the objective law of the architecture but by the subjective standpoint of the spectator who is just entering – a representation which owes to precisely this perspective arrangement a large part of its peculiarly 'intimate' effect. (Qtd. in Puttfarken, 94)
Using a dried gourd hanging from the rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's courage, in the face of a long brewing philological controversy[1] with St. Augustine in his preference[2] for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the Book of Jonah. The Old Testament text closes abruptly (Jonah 4) with an epistolary warning[3] based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of Aesop's fables such as The Gourd and the Palm-tree. Jerome elected to use hedera (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin cucurbita from which the related English plant name cucumber is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ ""I am the Vine, you are the branches"". In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7448167,"Self-Portrait, or Portrait of the Artist in a Redingote, is an oil-on-canvas painting by French romantic artist Théodore Chassériau, painted in 1835 when the artist was 16. It is housed at the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

One of the few self-portraits Chassériau painted, Portrait of the Artist in a Redingote shows him standing and facing left, one hand concealed within his black jacket, a small book held within his other hand, at rest upon a red tablecloth. In the background is a gray-green wall, upon which hangs a palette in the upper left corner. The painter's pose is elegant, and his gaze has been described as ""astonishingly young, and at the same time, weary"".[1]

Although the painting has been compared to classical and contemporary prototypes—portraits by Raphael, Bronzino, Titian, and Ingres have been cited as inspirations—the painting is consistent with a series of portraits of family members painted by Chassériau in his youth.[1] The portrait is a frank portrayal of Chassériau's unattractive features, much commented upon during his life: Alice Ozy, later his mistress, referred to him as ""the monkey"".[1] By comparison, a self-portrait of 1838, also in the Louvre, appears more idealized.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2529918,"St. George or St. George and the Dragon is a small painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, executed c. 1503-1505. It is housed in the Louvre in Paris. A later version of the same subject is the St. George in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

This painting and the equally small Saint Michael, also in the Louvre,[1] are a pair. In the Mazarin Collection they were joined together, forming a diptych, and bound in leather. Louis XIV acquired them from Mazarin's heirs in 1661.[2]

Saint George has sometimes been ascribed to the artist's Roman period, because the horse resembles one of the horses of Monte Cavallo (the Quirinal Palace). However, Raphael could easily have known this particular horse from a drawing of it, done by one of Leonardo's pupils.[3] To judge by the still somewhat naïve and Peruginesque style of the painting, it is really one of Raphael's early works, dating from about 1504. He did another painting of the same subject a little later (the mentioned panel in Washington D. C.), and towards the end of his life he painted a large Sant Michael which is also in the Louvre.

Giovanni Lomazzo, in his Trattato della Pittura (1584), mentions a Saint George by Raphael, commissioned by the Duke of Urbino, which was painted on a little chess-board (tavoliere). According to the old catalogues the small Saint Michael, if not the saint George as well, had a draught-board on the back which is now covered over.[4] Examination by means of X-rays and infrared has not confirmed this statement. In the abovementioned book, Lomazzo seems to have confused various pictures of the same subject.[5] If one can rely to some extent on his late and somewhat muddled testimony, it is possible that the two paintings in the Louvre were painted for the Duke of Urbino.

The Uffizi Gallery has a pen-and-wash cartoon for the Saint George (seen here below).

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6034540,"Saint Apollonia is a 1636 oil-on-canvas painted by the Spanish artist Francisco de Zurbarán. It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris.

Bought by the Louvre in 1867 from the collection of Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, this painting was perhaps part of the high altar of San José in the church of the Discalced Fathers of Mercy in Seville, together with a Saint Joseph Crowned by Christ and a God the Father now in the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville, and possibly a Saint Lucy in the Museum of Chartres, believed to be a companion piece to the Louvre painting - this last must be a studio work, however.[1]

The painting can be grouped with the pictures for the altar in the transept of the church of San José in Seville, dated 1636. It belongs to Zurbarán's most balanced period, when he produced his greatest masterpieces.

Renaissance artists had clothed their saints in classical draperies. Adopting to a certain extent the attitude of the Middle Ages, certain 17th century painters, such as Georges de La Tour, Zurbarán, and Caravaggio dressed them in the contemporary fashion. The natural mediators between God and the faithful are thus seen in a kind of mystical familiarity.[2]

Saint Apollonia was the patroness of dentists, hence the attribute she carries. Her martyrdom is said to have included the extraction of all her teeth.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16915832,"The Young Martyr (French: La Jeune Martyre) is an oil painting by the French painter Paul Delaroche. It was completed in 1855[1] and is based on the Romantic style of genre painting. It is held at the Louvre, in Paris. The first version of the painting is from 1853 and is held at the Hermitage Museum, in Saint Petersburg.

The Young Martyr represents both Delaroche's emphasis on historical accuracy and flair for drama and emotionality in painting as it depicts the historical martyrdom of a Christian woman, while, at the same time, an otherworldly halo, emanating above the Martyr's forehead, emphasizes the painting's dramatic, emotional effect.

The Young Martyr is 1.71×1.48 m, or 67.3×58.3 inches.[2] Although the painting is rectangular, the top of the painting is circumscribed in an ovular, golden frame.

Oil was Paul Delaroche's medium of choice when painting The Young Martyr, as oil allowed him to manipulate the precise details in the painting over a long period of time, and, therefore, capture a high level of detail for “the appearance of the highest finish.”[3]  As such, “the dignity of forms, the striking effect of the chiaroscuro, and those bluish grey tones which seemed to suit so well the touching sadness of the subject,”[4] in The Young Martyr begins in the upper left-hand corner of the painting, where the figures of a man and a woman, embracing each other in terror upon seeing the drowned Christian, are barely visible.  Although the identity of the figures is unclear, it is generally thought that they are the young Christian's parents.[by whom?] As the sun sets behind the couple, the last rays of light point directly across the painting towards the Martyr. Also in the upper left-hand corner of the painting, a faint white star can be seen in the sky, just above the grieving couple. The presence of this star in the painting as its inclusion may allude to other historical or religious narratives.[citation needed] For example, if The Young Martyr was painted as a morning scene, with the rising sun in the far background, the faint star above the grieving parents may allude to the morning star, or Lucifer, from the Bible.[citation needed] As such, this star would suggest the presence of the Devil, or of evil (metaphorically) in the painting.[5]  On the other hand, if The Young Martyr was painted as a scene taking place at sunset, then the star in the left-hand corner could be seen as the North Star, and, therefore, possibly as an allusion to God or Jesus.[6]  The Martyr's hands are bound by rope, as she gently floats upon the surface of the Tiber. With her body erect (potentially suggesting the rigor mortis),[citation needed] the Martyr, appears both dead and alive. Delaroche details around the Martyr's right hand small, delineated ripples, barely emanating from around the crests of the Martyr's fingers. Directly above the head of the Martyr is a halo. The Martyr's halo, precise and crisp, appears surreal in contrast to the rest of the painting; furthermore, this halo helps to stage The Young Martyr as it exists as the primary source of light for the otherwise dimly lit Christian.

On the surface, The Young Martyr depicts the sacrifice of a young Christian woman into the Tiber River. However, what the painting alludes to is not merely the countless Christian martyrs throughout the centuries, but specifically the martyrdom of Christians under the rule of the Roman emperor Diocletian- when Christians were systematically persecuted for their religious beliefs.[7][better source needed]  Briefly, the Roman Emperor Diocletian ruled in the 3rd and 4th centuries. About nineteen years into his reign, however, Diocletian, a polytheist, instituted the systematic persecution of Christians with the Diocletianic Persecution of 303-311 AD. Under these laws, Christians were expected to sacrifice and honor gods they themselves did not believe in, under penalty of imprisonment or death. As such, although the painting of The Young Martyr does not overtly allude to Diocletian, it could easily be said[by whom?] that, since the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians is so well known in history, and so often cited in Art, the Persecution would have served as a firm foundation for Delaroche,[citation needed] artistically, and would have given Delaroche ample reason to paint the martyrdom of a young Christian. Delaroche opted to depict the martyrdom of a female Christian in The Young Martyr. Although Delaroche is known to have “introduced the genii or muses, who symbolize or reign over the arts,”[8] and to have often idealized female figures, the choice to depict the martyrdom of a young woman may, more truly, have been part of Delaroche's response to the death of his wife, Louise Vernet,[citation needed] in 1845, whom he was known to have included as a figure in many of his paintings, for homage.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20083777,"The Crucifixion is an oil on canvas painting by Anthony van Dyck, produced c. 1630. It is 2.51 m high.

It was originally commissioned as the high altar-piece in the convent of the Récollets in Lille during van Dyck's second Antwerp period, between his return from Italy in 1627 and his departure for London in 1632. It returned to a theme he had already painted around 1617-19 during his first Antwerp period, when he was still a studio-assistant to Rubens - this was Crucifixion with the Virgin Mary, St John and St Mary Magdalene, sold to Rubens in 1621 as the high altarpiece for the Jesuit church at the abbaye Saint-Winnoq in Bergues, now in the musée du Louvre.[1] The second work's composition is more original, with a less central cross in an oblique position to give depth to the scene. The sky and the Magdalene's hair show the influence of the Venetian masters van Dyck had seen during his time in Italy. 

It was seized during the French Revolution and in 1795 it was part of the founding collection of the Palais des beaux-arts de Lille, where it still resides.[2][3]

The three colours worn by the three mourners are symbolic:[4] golden yellow by Mary Magdalene (eternal light), red by John the Evangelist (the Passion) and blue by the Virgin Mary (the mantle of humanity). The third shadowed figure to the far right is unclear, but may be one of the Three Marys. The crucifixion occurred at Golgotha (""the place of the skull"") and so Adam's skull is shown at the foot of the cross, to the lower left, under a thistle, symbolising the misfortune of the Fall and Original Sin,[4] its spines invoking Christ's crown of thorns. In the semi-circle above the cross is a 'mystic delta' symbolising the Holy Trinity.

The sitter has been identified (but without certainty) as Mademoiselle Rose, an artists' model who according to Alfred Robaut, Delacroix's biographer, posed several times for him and for Richard Parkes Bonington, and who perhaps distributed her favours impartially between the two artists.[1] In a letter to his friend Pierret, usually dated 1820, Delacroix wrote: 
I had tried to persuade Felix (Guillemardet) to come and join us tomorrow, but he said that the shortage of money had got the better of Mademoiselle Rose's bottom on this occasion.[2]
This particular nude is represented with an almost naturalistic sincerity, without any decorative arrangement. Although it already displays the variations of light on flesh which interested the artist so deeply, the pigment, applied in masterly touches in a granular impasto, has not yet acquired the fluidity which was to owe to the influence of English painting. This first made itself felt at the salon of 1824, where Delacroix saw works by John Constable, and increased in 1825, the date of his visit to London.[3]

The upward trend of his work, clearly seen in this painting, brings its date to the period 1820–1822, but cannot be fixed precisely. However, the nude has not only a pictorial interest: Delacroix brings to the painting an emotion which is firmly rooted in Romanticism. Moreover, the slight timidity of the attitude, the somewhat anxious expression of the face, give to this life-class painting a quality of humanity that is purely French Romantic.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47412198,"Allegory of Vanity and Repentance is a 1616 oil painting by the Dutch artist Cornelis van Haarlem. It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 1969. The painting's lesser known and lesser used title is Human Love and Divine Love; it was also known in the past as Pagan Life and Christian Life. Although the Dutch Republic was mostly Protestant in 1616, van Haarlem's painting was made for a Catholic patron.[2][1]

The foreground of the painting depicts a couple: a woman with a mirror and bare breasts, who personfies Vanitas; and a musician looking at the viewer, who personifies fleeting pleasure, as in the sounds of his instrument. On a table in front of them lay a crown, golden coins, and other precious wordly objects, such as a hanap. A bearded monk looking through the window attracts the viewer's attention by pointing towards Jesus praying in the Garden; his outstretched right hand towards the couple signifies that they may join him through repentance and be saved.[1][2]

There are two groups of naked women: two models lying in the foreground plus three bathers in the background, on the right. One of the models of this painting is Andrée Hessling, who became the first wife of Renoir's son, Jean. The natural setting displayed in the painting was the large garden of the house owned by the painter in Cagnes-sur-Mer.[1]

In the painting, Renoir removed any reference to the contemporary world and showed ""a timeless nature"". The theme of the bather is predominant in the final season of Renoir's paintings: the women portrayed by the painter are free and uninhibited. These bathers are ""melted in the nature and the forms merge with the trees, flowers and the shares of red water"".[2]

The painting received criticism because of ""the enormousness of the legs and arms, the weakness of flesh, and the pinkish color of the models"".[2]

This work (and its pendant Lot and his Daughters, today in the Louvre), was painted in 1654 for Charles II, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat, and delivered in 1657. It was sold between 1715 and 1720 and later belonged to John Charles Robinson. Robinson presented it to the Strasbourg museum in 1893, as gesture of friendship towards its director, Wilhelm von Bode, who had purchased several items from his collection.[1] [The accession date was given as 1896 in previous publications.][2]

Contrary to the Biblical narrative in the Book of Judges, but according to the retelling by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, Delilah is shown as cutting Samson's hair herself (in the Bible, a man is summoned to do this task). The severity of the composition, the muted colors, and Delilah's sculptural profile, are characteristic of Guercino's late, classical manner. The theme of the painting and of its pendant, Lot and his daughters, does furthermore constitute a warning against the dangers of drunkenness.[2]

A preparatory drawing (current location unknown) depicts Delilah at half-length, with a more girlish expression and a less athletic build.[1][3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1986597,"The Orléans Madonna is a c.1506-1507 painting of the Madonna and Child by Raphael. It was acquired by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans for the Orléans collection, giving it its present name. It is now in the Musée Condé in Chantilly.[1][2]

Copies of the work are mentioned in Piedmont in the early 16th century and the Piedmont-born painter Giovanni Martino Spanzotti mentioned it as a ""tabuleto fiorentino"" in a 1507 letter to Charles II of Savoy. Several other studio copies of the painting were made between 1507 and 1526, four of which are still known to survive, including one at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and one in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, USA.

The original work remained in the collection of the Dukes of Savoy until the 17th century. Christine of France bought four Raphael paintings in 1647, probably including this one. The work then vanishes until 1729, when it is mentioned in the Recueil d'estampes commissioned by Pierre Crozat as belonging to a man called Passart then passing to abbé François de Camps (1643-1723), scholar and bishop of Pamiers, and finally to Philippe d'Orléans (1674-1723). It was then kept in the Palais-Royal until the French Revolution.

In 1791 Philippe Égalité sold his whole collection of Italian paintings to his banker Édouard de Walkiers to cover his colossal debts. de Walkiers resold the collection to his cousin François Laborde de Méreville. In 1798, the whole collection was sold in London to Lords Bridgewater, Gower and Carlyle, though they then resold the Madonna, which was then acquired by the collectors Hibbert in London in 1799, Nieuwenhuys in 1831 in Brussels and Delamarre or de Lahaute in Paris. Next it was acquired by marquis Aguado in 1835 and finally by the businessman and parliamentarian François Delessert (1780-1868). Delessert's collection was sold a year after his death and the Madonna was acquired by Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale, who hung it in the 'Santuario' of his château de Chantilly, alongside Three Graces and a panel by Filippino Lippi.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15874391,"The Excommunication of Robert the Pious (French: L'Excommunication de Robert le Pieux) is a 1875 painting by Jean-Paul Laurens, held by the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris. It depicts the excommunication of Robert II of France in the year 998.[1]

The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1875 and, together with Laurens' other work on display that year, L'Interdit, was generally reckoned to be the finest historical paintings entered.[2] It was bought from the artist by the State in 1875, and exhibited at the Luxembourg Museum until 1929, when it was transferred to the Louvre. It has belonged to the collections of the Musée d'Orsay since 1982.[3]

The work was Laurens' first after his visit to Italy, which influenced his technique. His use of colour in this painting is noticeably less sober and more animated than in his previous work.[4] It was one of a series of historical paintings by Laurens that depicted various parts of the narrative of Robert the Pious. These were L'Interdit (1875), showing France being placed under interdict for his refusal to end his relationship with his wife Bertha,[5][6] and Répudiation de la reine Berthe (1883), showing their eventual parting.

The painting depicts the moment after the excommunication of Robert II by Pope Gregory V for refusing to repudiate his second wife, Berthe. Robert was both her second cousin and godfather to her son.

As the representatives of the papacy leave the throne room, Robert and Bertha stare into space, in the grip of their dilemma. The royal scepter lies on the ground, and the candle which has been blown out and placed on the ground, as provided for in the ritual of excommunication, is still smoking. The austere decor of the room offers little to distract the viewer from the faces of the two protagonists as they stare with foreboding at the smoking candle before them. They are completely alone, the entire court having abandoned them.[7] Their expressions give an indication of the terrifying scene they have just witnessed.[8] Jules Claretie described it as exactly like a theatrical scene, and the work as not so much a painting as a moment before the curtain falls.[6]

The painting depicts the count of Scandiano, Giulio Boiardo [it], of the House of Boiardo [it], and his wife, Silvia Sanvitale. It was bought in 1914 for the museum by Wilhelm von Bode with an attribution to Dosso Dossi, and that attribution (to Dossi or his circle) was maintained until 1997. Only since that date is the painting attributed with certainty to a young dell'Abbate, who painted it in Modena at the time when he was also working on other commissions for the Boiardo's palace, the Rocca dei Boiardo [it]. The former title of the painting was A Duke of Ferrara and his Wife.[1][2]

The double portrait of the count and countess is most unusual in that the emphasis is very much placed on the wife, who is depicted in the act of closing a book that she was just reading, while her husband almost timidly approaches from behind. It appears as a testament to Giulio Boiardo's admiration and love for Silvia Sanvitale's strong intellect and personality.[1][2]

The painting was bought from the Paris art dealer Édouard Warneck in 1893, as a work by a follower of Rogier van der Weyden. It was attributed to Provoost by Georges Hulin de Loo in 1902, and described as one of Provoost's most personal works by Max J. Friedlaender in 1931. Friedländer also stated that the work had to have been painted in the early 1500s, which is today commonly accepted. In the 1930s however, much importance was given to the trompe-l'œil inscription on a piece of paper in the lower left corner, bearing the date 1488, so that even subsequently, the painting was thought to be an early Provoost work. Only in 2003 did infrared photography of the painting's surface definitely establish that the inscription is a posterior addition, without information value about the work's inception.[3][1][2]

Provoost's Nursing Madonna presents compositional and typological similarities with Simon Marmion's earlier Madonna and Child, now in the National Gallery of Victoria, which had itself been inspired by the depiction of Mary and Baby Jesus in Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, a hugely influential painting by Van der Weyden. The Strasbourg painting was in turn much repeated and copied by Provoost, his studio, and his followers (at least eleven posterior versions are known).[1]

María Blanchard (born María Gutiérrez-Cueto y Blanchard;[1] 6 March 1881 – 5 April 1932) was a Spanish painter. She was known for developing a unique style of Cubism.[2][3]

Blanchard was born on 6 March 1881 in Santander, Spain.[4] She was the daughter of journalist Enrique Gutiérrez Cueto and Concepción Blanchard Santisteban. She was the cousin of Mexican artist Germán Cueto.[1]


She was born with several physical deformities, including a deformed spine,[5][6] which some attributed to Blanchard's mother's fall during her pregnancy. Blanchard was born with kyphoscoliosis and bilateral hip disarticulation. Her growth was stunted and she walked with a limp, causing her to be teased at school and nicknamed ""the witch"".[7] The emotional pain this caused can be seen in many of her artworks' themes.[1] Blanchard turned to painting to express her sadness.[8] Her father was a large influence in her life, encouraging her to draw.[9] 
In 1903, she moved to Madrid and studied at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando under Spanish artists such as Emilio Sala and Manuel Benedito.[1] Sala taught Blanchard ""precision"" and the ""exuberant use of colour,"" which would feature in her early compositions.[1] In 1908, after Blanchard won a third prize for her painting Primeros pasos at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts,[10] the Santander government awarded her a grant to support her education in the arts.[1] In 1909, this grant allowed her to continue her artistic education at the Academie Vitti in Paris under Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa and Kees van Dongen.[11] Here she discovered cubist painting, and was influenced by Jacques Lipchitz and Juan Gris.[11][12] In 1914, due to the First World War, Blanchard left Paris and returned to Madrid. She shared a studio in her mother's house with some of the artists she met in Paris.[13] In 1915, her art was displayed in an exhibition organized by Ramón Gómez de la Serna[1] at the Museo de Arte Moderno (Madrid). She was contacted to teach art in Salamanca (Madrid), but was disappointed by the experience.[9]

In 1916, before the end of the war, Blanchard moved to Paris, where she would spend the rest of her life.[1] There, she met many Cubist artists and began developing her own style of Cubism.[1] She became close friends with Juan Gris, a Spanish Cubist painter, who heavily influenced her work.[1] Blanchard joined the Section d'Or, a Cubist art group[14] Early paintings, such as Woman With a Fan, show flat, interlocked shapes.[14] Her style evolved to become more figurative and traditional over the years; her paintings became harsh, with bright clashing colors and melancholic themes.[14] The resulting artwork was very emotionally expressive.

Demand for Blanchard's art increased after the 1920 showings in France and Belgium, and the 1921 exhibition at the Society of Independent Artists.[14] She came into contact with significant art dealers, but due to the adverse economic situation which followed, many collectors stopped investing in her work. She became financially dependent on her friend, Frank Flausch (1878–1926) until his death.[1] Without Flausch, Blanchard was able to sell paintings to galleries in Paris and a few private patrons.

In 1927, Gris died.[1] Blanchard was severely affected and fell into a state of depression.[5] Her sister, Carmen, and nephews came to live with her in Paris, alleviating her loneliness but worsening her financial situation.[14] In her deteriorating health, Blanchard turned to religion and considered joining a convent, but never did.[7] She continued painting to support her sister and nephews.

Blanchard's health gradually declined over the following years. She contracted tuberculosis, making it impossible for her to paint. On 5 April 1932, she died at age 51 in Paris.[1]

Blanchard's work was featured in the Botin Foundation of Santander, Spain during 2012–2013.[14] The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Hood Museum of Art, and Courtauld Institute of Art display original works from Blanchard. In 2021, the Prado Museum approved the purchase of Blanchard's La Boulonnaise.[15] Blanchard was described by Gris as ""[having] talent."" Jacques Lipchitz wrote about her, saying that Blanchard ""was a sincere artist and her paintings contain a painful sentiment of unusual violence."" Diego Rivera described her work as being ""pure expression.""[16]

The Family Reunion or Portraits of the Family is an oil-on-canvas painting executed in 1867 by the French painter Frédéric Bazille. It is the largest surviving canvas (152 by 230 cm) by this artist. It is now in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[1][2]

The painter took inspiration to create this painting from a meeting that took place at his residence in Méric, near Montpellier, in the summer of 1867. Under the shade of a large chestnut tree, on a sunny day, which enhances the variations between light and shade, Bazille represents his parents seated on a bench, on the left. On the terrace also depicted are his uncle Eugéne des Hours and wife, his cousin Pauline with her husband Émile Teulon, and his brother Marc with his wife Suzanne and another cousin, Camille, back from a walk. The author depiction of himself, at the far left, behind his seated parents, was only included in the composition later.

The women's dresses in light blue with navy blue dots represent a fashion of the Summer of 1867, and were considered an unmistakable sign of the 19th century bourgeoisie.

Regarding the pose of the figures, it can be noted that eight of the eleven people depicted look at the observer directly or indirectly but without any interaction between them. It is worth highlighting how Bazille generously manages to reflect his love for the light of Southern France.

Even so, the author was not completely satisfied and, after its presentation at the Salon, he touched up the work during the winter, exchanging some puppies for an unnatural still life.

In contrast with Claude Monet's picture Women in the Garden, which Bazille had recently bought from the artist, and in which the subjects are captured absorbed in their own activity, Bazille's subjects are all motionless, looking at the viewer, giving his work the stilted feel of a wedding photograph.

The painting was accepted for exhibition by the Salon in 1868 in preference to Monet's more daring compositions. It was acquired in 1905 by the State museums from the Bazille family.[3][4]

The then young writer Émile Zola was commissioned to write a review of the painting, in which he highlighted the painter's sensitivity when concerning the depiction of the natural light on the terrace, and also his attention to the clothing of the figures and his accuracy in portraying eleven people with all the details, poses and gestures characteristic of their own individual personalities. This causes each person to be presented in a similar way to a photograph.[5]

The Youth of Agde (l'Éphèbe d'Agde) is a bronze statue discovered on September 13, 1964, on the bed of the river Herault on the south-eastern coast of France, by Denis Fanquerle and divers from the Agde Marine Archaeological Research Group. It is probably associated with an ancient Greek shipwreck.[1]

Standing at a height of 1.33 meters, this bronze statue is dated to the 2nd century BC (late Hellenistic period), and depicts a young man, probably a ruler. His features resemble those of Lysippos' Doryphoros, suggesting that its creator was a student of the master sculptor.

The statue itself is in poor condition due to its immersion in the Herault Estuary for so many years. The surface of the bronze is corroded, and the lower half of both arms and both feet are missing. One foot was found six months after the initial discovery, about 600 meters away from the original find, buried under 1.5 meters of silt deposits on the bed of the river. The rest of the parts have yet to be located.

The Youth of Agde, for the first fifteen years of its second life on land, resided in the storage rooms of the Louvre. It is now on display at the Agde Museum[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6314660,"Jupiter et Sémélé (1894–95; English, Jupiter and Semele) is a painting by the French Symbolist artist Gustave Moreau (1826–1898).  It depicts a moment from the classical myth[1] of the mortal woman Semele, mother of the god Dionysus, and her lover, Jupiter, the king of the gods. She was treacherously advised by the goddess Juno, Jupiter's wife, to ask him to appear to her in all his divine splendor. He obliged, but, in so doing, brought about her violent death by his divine thunder and lightning. The painting is a representation of ""divinized physical love"" and the overpowering experience that consumes Semele as the god appears in his supreme beauty which has been called ""quite simply the most sumptuous expression imaginable of an orgasm"".[2]

Of this work, Moreau himself wrote, ""Semele, penetrated by the divine effluence, regenerated and purified by this consecration, dies struck by lightning and with her dies the genius of terrestrial love, the genius with the goat hooves"".[citation needed]


Moreau described his canvas thus: 
""In the midst of colossal aerial buildings, with neither foundations nor roof-tops, covered with teeming, quivering vegetation, this sacred flora standing out against the dark blues of the starry vaults and the deserts of the sky, the God so often invoked appears in his still veiled splendor.""[citation needed]

Moreau's work depicts an intricate, intense, and startling mystical world, haunting and heavily laden with symbolic imagery.  Its iconography is drawn from the ancient myth, from Symbolist writings and from his own personal interpretations, which are deliberately meant to be mysterious and ambiguous. Jupiter is represented conventionally, seated “in Majesty” with the hapless and bloodied Semele astride his right thigh. His gaze is severe, wide-eyed and fixed straight ahead in fierce prepossession. His throne and surrounding court, however, present an unorthodox and extravagant profusion of architectural and vegetal elements which — while depicted in fine, realistic, even  jewel-like, detail — give the overall impression of a dream-like fantasy world. Everywhere a profusion of vivid colors vies with dark shadows for prominence. Countless teeming gods, goddesses and allegorical figures seem to exist at different scales, independent of, and oblivious to, one another.  The eye must accommodate bizarre shifts in proportion as it ranges across the canvas. Among the figures are three immediately at the feet of Jupiter: a figure of ""Sadness"" (cradling a bloodied sword), a Great Pan, and a female “Death” holding aloft a white lily. (Moreau: “At the foot of the throne, Death and Sorrow form the tragic basis of Human Life, and not far from them, under the aegis of the eagle of Jupiter, the great Pan, symbol of Earth, bows his sorrowful brow, mourning his slavery and exile, while at his feet is piled the somber phalanx of the monsters of Erebus and Night….”)  Jupiter's right foot rests on a snake biting its own tail. A frightful Hecate, with her polos and crescent moon, appears in the lower left corner. Among the other figures are a three-headed demon and several winged, angelic figures.[citation needed]

The French writer and painter Malcolm de Chazal (1902–1981) called the central image of Jupiter and Semele “this birth-death in one”. The Swedish surrealist Ragnar von Holten (1934–2009) described the work as “an allegory of regeneration by death”.[citation needed]

The theme of Jupiter and Semele has also been interpreted by the painters Jacopo Tintoretto  (ca. 1545) and Jean-Baptiste Deshays de Colleville (ca. 1760).

Rue de la Chaussée in Argenteuil or A Square in Argenteuil is an 1872 painting by Alfred Sisley, now in the Musée d'Orsay, where it has hung since 1986. It was left to the French state in 1906 by Étienne Moreau-Nélaton, who had bought it earlier that year from François Depeaux's collection via the art dealer Georges Petit.[1][2]

Sisley painted several works of Argenteuil and the neighbouring stretches of the Seine, probably on frequent visits to his friend Claude Monet, who had moved to the village in December 1871.[3] In spring 1872 Monet painted Camille and Sisley's companion Marie-Eugénie in a garden.[4]

Sisley also made use of Monet's boat-studio to paint near the île Marande.[4] At least twice the two artists set up their easels next to each other - in 1872 both artists painted works entitled Rue de la Chaussée in Argenteuil and Boulevard Héloïse, Argenteuil,[3] though Shone argues Sisley's works have a more balanced composition, particularly Rue, with tones reminiscent of Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot.[3]

It is on display at the Musée Condé, in Chantilly.

This painting depicts a scene set in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. Two rows of cuirassiers await the signal to charge, with five non-commissioned officers in front of them also ready. They are wearing the distinctly coloured uniforms of the 12th Cuirassier Regiment.[1] On the left, a Division General in a tail-coat and distinctive gold and scarlet sash is pointing, while addressing a cuirassier officer, probably the Colonel of the 12th Regiment. Behind them stands a trumpeter in yellow, an aide-de-camp to the Division General in a hussar-style uniform, and two more cuirassiers. On the right, a group of artillerymen are moving in front of a row of houses. In the far distance, on a hill between the second and third non-commissioned officer from the right, Napoleon can be seen and his chief of staff.[1]

Meissonier's intention was not to depict a specific battle, but rather a celebration of the cuirassiers of the First French Empire.[1]

The painting was first exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris. It was bought for 275,000 francs  by the Belgian collector Prosper Crabbe,[1] and then passed into the collection of Ernest Secrétan. In the 1889 auction of that collection, it was listed as lot 39 and bought for 199,652 francs by Henri d'Orleans, duke of Aumale. The painting was later donated, alongside the rest of his collection and property, to the Institut de France; it now forms part of the Musée Condé.[2]

The artist neither signed nor dated it, but it was produced in the first phase of his career, probably between 1620 and 1625.[1] It is also known as The Hurdy-Gurdy Player in a Hat (Le Vielleur au chapeau) or The Hurdy-Gurdy Player with a Fly (Le Vielleur à la mouche). It is now in the Musée d'Arts de Nantes.

The painting depicts an impoverished blind beggar singing in the street to the music of his hurdy-gurdy, an instrument traditionally associated with street singers. The hurdy-gurdy, portrayed in great detail in de la Tour's canvas, works by means of a hand turned wheel rubbing against a set of strings, whose pitch can be adjusted by hand operated wedges.

The beggar's distorted face and worn clothing are designed to invoke sympathy in the viewer for his situation. The existence of a fly on the singer's doublet (above his right knee) gives the work its alternative name and, in its proximity to such a beautiful instrument, can be interpreted as a comment on the fragility of life.

The first recorded mention of the work is in the collection of the Nantes-born diplomat François Cacault (1847–1805) at Clisson – a posthumous assessment of his collection on 6 November 1808 called the work ""very capital"", attributed it to Murillo and valued it at 6000 francs. The city collection bought it and it was hung in mayor Bertrand Geslin's office in the town hall, before being moved to its present home in 1830.[2] From 1830 until 1903 the museum's catalogues noted it as a work by Murillo or the Spanish school.[3] In 1836 Prosper Mérimée, then inspector general of France's historic monuments, admired the work during a trip to survey paintings in western France. 

From 1923 doubts about the attribution of the painting began to surface but it was not until 1934–35 that general acceptance of its authorship, primarily by comparison with other similar works by the artist, was achieved.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3753366,"Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase is an oil painting on canvas created by the post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh in Paris, 1887.  The painting is now part of the collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France. This work was made at a time of the life of Van Gogh when he first encountered influences from Impressionists and  became aware of light and color, implementing it in his paintings. This painting presages some of his most famous subsequent works, and stands out from other still lifes because of the implementation of mixed techniques and complementary colors.

Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase is an oil painting on canvas measuring 73.5 by 60.5 cm which was painted in Paris in 1887.[1][2] It depicts a bouquet of golden imperial fritillaries in a copper vase, the shiny patina of which (surrounded by lavender highlights) ""reflects the color of the flowers as the motted wall stands out with a combination of blue, green and yellow shades"" with flecks of white like ""sparkling lights.""[2][3] The ""moody blues"" and ""vibrant golds"" in the painting can also be appreciated in other of Van Gogh's works such as The Starry Night and Bedroom at Arles. [2] This painting with its ""thickly applied paint and convoluted brushstrokes"" presages Van Gogh´s famous Sunflowers.[4] Color was an important element in his work at the time it was painted, as it expresses the artist´s ""elevated mood"" during the period he lived with his brother Theo in Montmartre in Paris (1886-1888).[2] This piece has been described as a ""riotous celebration of color, texture and light,""[2] as it shows how Van Gogh accomplished light and the varied ways in which he applied the paint with ""dashes in the background, directional brushstrokes on the table, impasto highlights on the metal vase"".[5]

Vincent, as mentioned by the Scottish painter, Archibald Standish Hartrick, was interested in a theory that stated that ""the eye carried a portion of the last sensation it had enjoyed into the next, so that something of both must be included in every picture made"".[6] The inspiration for the selection of complementary colors (orange and blue in this painting), came from noticing that ""when entering a lamplit room out of the night increases the orange effect of the light, and in the contrary case, the blue.""[6] As Vincent wrote, he tried to ""render intense colour and not a grey harmony.""[7] Eugène Murer, the Impressionist painter contemporaneous with Van Gogh who owned the Fritillaries in a Copper Vase painting, considered him ""the greatest colorist of the century after Renoir.""[8] Van Gogh was always open minded about trying new painting techniques and even liked to use several in a same work.[9] This painting is an example of this, as it mixes Pointillism in the background as ""expression of the nature of the central focus of the painting"" [10] and Impressionism in the brushstrokes of the flowers and vase.[9] Van Gogh applied these techniques inspired by Impressionists and Neo-Impressionists of the time, that would be later used in other pieces, mainly portraits and self-portraits.[10][11]

Out of 900 works, Van Gogh signed only about 130, Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase among them (upper left corner).[9][11] This means that he considered it a potential work that could be sold.[11] The signature in the picture reads ""Vincent"", as he signed since he arrived to Paris and from then on. It is said that this was because French people could not pronounce his last name.[9] Another theory states that he wanted to get away from the Van Gogh name as his ancestors were more conservative than him. He wanted to be recognized as an individual to be ""unique"".[9]

Imperial fritillaries (Fritillaria imperialis) are bulbs that were grown in France and Germany at the end of the 19th century, nowadays they are generally seen in gardens in Europe during spring (April and May).[1][2] Because of this it is assumed that Van Gogh painted this work at that time of year.[1] The orange-red flower is also known as the imperial crown or kaiser's crown.[2] Each bulb grows between three and ten flowers, so Van Gogh used one or two bulbs to make the bouquet depicted in this picture.[1]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q38516820,"Virgin and Child with two Angels is a panel painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 558.[2]

Owing to its comparatively poor condition, due to the peeling off of some tempera layers as well as some ancient restoration attempts, the painting had not unanimously been attributed to Botticelli himself: critics like Bernard Berenson, who had at first declared it to be genuine, later attributed it to Botticelli's workshop. Today, art historians largely agree that it is indeed an early painting by Sandro Botticelli. Some disagreement existed on how early, given that the painting displays clear influences of Botticelli's master Filippo Lippi (which would put it in the early 1460s), but also an obvious knowledge of the works of Andrea del Verrocchio (which would put it in the later 1460s). It is now agreed upon that the painting was made in the year 1468 or 1469.[1]

Virgin and Child with two Angels was bought in London by Karl Trübner [fr] in 1904, from the heirs of Horatio Granville Murray-Stewart (1834–1904), former High Sheriff of Donegal. It was inherited by the Strasbourg museum in 1908, together with other paintings from the Trübner collection, such as Van Everdingen's Nordic Landscape with a Castle on a Hill.[1][2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q429753,"The 1821 Derby at Epsom, or Horse Race (Course de chevaux, traditionally called Le Derby de 1821 à Epsom) is an 1821 painting by Théodore Géricault in the Louvre Museum, showing The Derby of that year.

Fascinated by horses, Géricault made many paintings portraying them. Working for a while at the imperial stables at Versailles, he had the opportunity to study them in detail and made numerous portraits of horses.[1] Other paintings of horses by Géricault include  Officer Hunter Horse of the Imperial Guard Charging (1812) and Race of Free Horses in Rome (1819).[2]

This work is a rare and valuable example of painting dated from his travel in England, when Géricault preferred to work in lithography. It was painted for the English horse dealer Adam Elmore. The race itself was won by Gustavus, becoming the first grey to win the race. The painting was acquired by the Musée du Louvre in 1866.[3]

The position of the horses' legs in the painting - with both front and hind legs extended outwards while airborne - is never actually exhibited by a galloping horse. This was conclusively demonstrated by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, with high-speed photography showing that galloping horses are airborne when their legs are beneath the body, just before the hind legs touch ground.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3646498,"Slaughtered Ox, also known as Flayed Ox, Side of Beef, or Carcass of Beef, is a 1655 oil on beech panel still life painting by Rembrandt. It has been in the collection of the Louvre in Paris since 1857. A similar painting is in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, possibly not created by Rembrandt himself but probably by one of his pupils, perhaps Carel Fabritius.[1]  Other similar paintings by Rembrandt or more likely his circle are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.

The work follows in a tradition of artworks showing butchery, for example Pieter Aertsen's A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms (1551) and Annibale Carracci's Butcher's Shop (c. 1583), and perhaps more specifically Joachim Beuckelaer's Slaughtered Pig (1563).  Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c. 1635.  Another pre-1655 painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work by Rembrandt himself.  In northern Europe, November was traditionally the time for slaughtering livestock, before winter made feed difficult to find.

The painting measures 95.5 by 68.8 centimetres (37.6 in × 27.1 in), and is signed and dated ""Rembrandt f. 1655"".  It shows the butchered carcass of a bull or an ox, hanging in a wooden building, possibly a stable or lean-to shed.  The carcass is suspended by its two rear legs, which are tied by ropes to a wooden crossbeam.  The animal has been decapitated and flayed of skin and hair, the chest cavity has been stretched open and the internal organs removed, revealing a mass of flesh, fat, connective tissue, joints, bones, and ribs.  The carcass is carefully coloured, and given texture by impasto.  In the background, a woman appears behind a half-open door, lifting the painting from still life into a genre painting, a scene of everyday life.  It is sometimes considered a vanitas or memento mori; some commentators make references to the killing of the fatted calf in the biblical story of the Prodigal Son, others directly to the Crucifixion of Jesus.

The painting was possibly owned by Christoffel Hirschvogel in 1661. It was viewed by Joshua Reynolds in the collection of Pieter Locquet in Amsterdam in 1781, and later owned by Louis Viardot, who sold it to the Louvre in 1857 for 5,000 francs.

The work's muscular depiction inspired Honoré Daumier, Eugène Delacroix, a series of works by  Chaïm Soutine, and Francis Bacon.  Most particularly, Bacon's Figure with Meat depicts Pope Innocent X, as painted by Velazquez, accompanied by ghostly echoes of the carcass from Rembrandt's painting.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24090,"The Crowning with Thorns is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian (Tiziano Vecellio) done during 1542 and 1543. It is housed in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France.

The painting was commissioned by the confraternity of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. It was brought to France after the Napoleonic conquest of the city in 1797.

In The Crowning with Thorns, painted for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, the space is compressed in the scene by arranging the figures on a shallow plane delimited by the wall of a building. There are explicit references to antiquity: the figure of Christ derives from the celebrated Laocoon, an antique statue discovered in Rome in 1506, an archetypal exemplum doloris (""example of pain""). Another famous antique sculptural fragment, the Belvedere Torso, provides the model for the upper body of the torturer on the left. With the inclusion of the bust of Tiberius Caesar, a direct reference to the Roman authorities who condemned Christ, Titian also pays homage to the classical past.

This is a brutal scene, in which Christ's tormentors twist the crown onto his head with their canes, but the violence is relieved and Christ's suffering exalted by the beauty of the colours, which especially in the blue and green to the right are colder than usual in deference to Titian's Roman sources. In Christ's foot extended on the steps, however, Titian pulls out all the Venetian stops and one can sense the blood flowing through the veins under the flesh. The pattern of the canes slices through the massed figures like the strokes of a knife, forming a Trinitarian triangle to the right of Christ's head. An inimitable Titian touch is the cane lying unused on the foremost step, still, shadowless and deadly, like a snake.[1]

According to Robert Haven Schauffler, the German painter Fritz von Uhde once considered it to be ""the greatest picture ever painted.""[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12015473,"Le Lit ('The Bed') (also known as Dans le lit, 'In Bed') is a painting by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec from around 1892 which depicts two women sharing a bed. The painting has been held by public collections in France since 1937, and by the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1986.

Le Lit was made in oil paints on cardboard, mounted on wood, and measures 53.5 by 70 centimetres (21.1 in × 27.6 in).

The painting is one of four paintings of similar date depicting individuals in bed, often interpreted as lesbian couples.

Toulouse-Lautrec became fascinated by the nightlife in Paris, particularly sex workers.  Through the 1890s, he spent more and more time painting everyday scenes of life in the official brothels, the maisons closes.  In 1892 he was commissioned to produce paintings for the salon at a brothel on the rue d'Ambroise [fr].  He spent time observing the brothel, its residents and visitors, while they worked and at quieter moments, and made sixteen portraits of the sex workers.  These paintings demonstrate a close and intimate observation and compassion towards the subjects, without any sense of sensationalism or voyeurism.

It depicts two women in a bed, gazing at each other.  The white sheets of the bed contrast with a red bedspread and with the headboard and wall behind.  The disembodied heads of the women face each other, their bodies concealed beneath mountains of bedclothes.  The painting is suffused by a warm glow, perhaps the rosy morning light, or a gas lamp.  The painting is often interpreted as depicting a lesbian liaison.

The painting was exhibited in Paris at the Le Barc de Boutteville gallery during the third exhibition of the Impressionists and symbolists (Nov 15, 1892 to circa February 1893).[1]

The painting was in the collection of French art collector Roger Marx [fr].  After Marx died in December 1913, it was sold the following year to another collector, Antonin Personnaz.  After Personnaz died in December 1936, it was donated to the French state in 1937.  It was held initially in the Musée du Louvre, and then transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986.

A similar work, Au lit, le baiser [fr], showing two women kissing, was sold at Sotheby's in London in February 2015 for £10,789,000, and another similarly titled work was sold at Christie's in New York in November 2015 for US$12,485,000.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16984914,"Bords de la Marne, also called Les Bords de la Marne and The Banks of the Marne, is a proto-Cubist oil painting on canvas created in 1909 by the French artist, theorist and writer Albert Gleizes. In this work can be seen a departure from the representation of the observable world. The development of Cubist and abstract art in the work of Gleizes was necessarily a transformation from the synthetic preoccupation with his subject matter. The passage of Gleizes' painting from an epic visionary figuration to total abstraction was foreshadowed during his proto-Cubist period. Bords de la Marne measures 54 × 65 cm, and is currently in the permanent collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon.

Gleizes' preoccupation for solidly constructed form is already manifest in his Fauve-like works between 1907 and 1909. Under the influence of Paul Cézanne, Symbolism, Pont Aven and Les Nabis, Gleizes produced some of his first Proto-Cubist paintings.

Bords de la Marne and other painting by Gleizes during this phase are close to the work of Henri Le Fauconnier, though the artist did not know each other at the time.[1]

Gleizes and the former members of the Abbaye de Créteil (notably Jules Romains, Henri-Martin Barzun and René Arcos) dreamed of a synthetic concept of the possibilities of the future, one of ""collectivity, multiplicity and simultaneity"" writes art historian Daniel Robbins: ""Their vision invariably encompassed broad subjects which, although dealing with reality, were restricted neither by the limitations of physical perception nor by a separation of scientific fact from intellectual meaning—even symbolic meaning. Even their images of simultaneity were synthetic because scope was too vast, both physically and symbolically, for one man's limited participation"".[1][2]

Between 1905 and 1908, Gleizes transited through Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism with a brief passage though Fauvism. By 1909 he began simplifying both his color and form. These paintings were parallel to the written and verbal ideas propounded at the Abbaye de Créteil.[1]

Experienced in the treatment of inclusive landscapes (writes Robbins), he nevertheless had to solve the problem of balancing many simultaneous visions on a painted surface. Gleizes mitigated the distortion of distance by linear perspective, by flattening the picture plane; his skies were on the same plane as the simple flat objects in front and, although scale was retained, a form in the distance would be brought to the foreground by making it bright. Every element of the painting had to be reduced to clear planes, treated as uniformly as possible...
According to Gleizes, Mercereau introduced him to Jean Metzinger in 1910; the year Mercereau organized the Jack of Diamonds Exhibition in Moscow. Before Gleizes and Metzinger had met, they were both single out by Louis Vauxcelles, who wrote disparaging comments about their ""cubes Blafards""[3] possibly regarding Metzinger's Portrait of Apollinaire and Gleizes' L'Arbre (The Tree) (1910), both exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants.[1]

Before 1911 a group of artists formed through the Mercereau connection, including Allard, Barzun, Beauduin, Castiaux, Jouve, Divoire, Parmentier, Marinetti, Brâncuși, Varlet, Apollinaire and Salmon.[4][5][6]

In his preface to the 1911 Brussels Indépendants, Apollinaire wrote: 

...thus has come a simple and noble art, expressive and measured, eager to discover beauty, and entirely ready to tackle those vast subjects which the painters of yesterday did not dare to undertake, abandoning them to the presumptuous, old-fashioned and boring daubers of the official Salons.
Unlike the style and subject matter of Picasso and Braque, the paintings of Albert Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger and others of the Mercereau group favored vast scenes (epic themes) representing modern life.[1]

Allard wrote of Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Metzinger, in a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne:

Thus is born at the antipodes of impressionism an art which cares little to imitate the occasional cosmic episode, but which offers to the intelligence of the spectator the essential elements of a synthesis in time, in all its pictorial fullness.[7]"

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3222406,"The Chord (L'Accord), alternatively known as The Serenader (Le Donneur de sérénades) and Mezzetino (Mézetin), is an oil on panel painting in the Musée Condé, Chantilly, by the French Rococo painter Antoine Watteau, variously dated c. 1714–1717. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, The Chord passed through numerous private collections, until it came into possession of Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale, son of King Louis Philippe I; as part of the Duke of Aumale's collection at the Château de Chantilly, The Chord was bequeathed to the Institut de France in 1884.

At 24 by 17 cm, the painting forms a single-figure full-length composition that depicts a male guitarist in theatrical costume, sitting amid the landscape. The guitarist, widely associated with the commedia dell'arte character Mezzetino, is a recurring subject in Watteau's art; based on a red and black chalk drawing owned by the Louvre, it is also present in two other paintings by Watteau, The Surprise (now in the Getty Museum, Los Angeles) and Pleasures of Love (now in the Alte Meister Gallery, Dresden).

The recorded provenance of The Chord begins in the mid-18th century, when it was in possession of the fermier géneral Marin Delahaye (1684-1753); at the sale after his death, held in Paris on January 1, 1754, the painting was lot 47, described as ""un tableau peint sur bois, représentant Mezetin par Vatteau, de 10 pouces de haut sur 7 pouces de large, dans sa bordure dorée,"" and sold for 300 livres to the certain Beauchamp.[1] Soon after that sale, it entered the collection of the painter and art dealer Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Lebrun (1748-1813), the husband of the prominent portrait painter Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun; Lebrun put The Chord on sale twice, as lot 58 at a May 1765 auction, and as lot 40 at a November 1778 auction respectively.

In the 1780s, the painting belonged to Antoine Claude Chariot (1733-1815), the commissaire-priseur du Châtelet; at a sale in January 1788, The Chord and another Watteau painting in the Chariot collection, The Worried Lover, were lot 44 sold back to Lebrun for 221 livres. Lebrun didn't keep the pair for long, and put it at auction on April 11, 1791, only to have them bought back for 132 livres. For a brief time, The Chord was owned by the art dealer Alexandre Joseph Paillet (1743-1814), and was sold as lot 25 at auction for 120 livres on February 13, 1792. Decades later, the painting resurfaced as lot 150 at auction in Paris on March 20–22, 1824, before entering the collection of Marquis André Joseph Maison (1798–1869), son of the prominent general and diplomat Nicolas Joseph Maison; with part of that collection, it was sold in 1868 to Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale, the fifth son of King Louis Philippe I. As part of the Duke of Aumale's collection at the Château de Chantilly, The Chord was bequeathed to the Institut de France in 1884.[2]

Among Watteau scholars, The Chord is generally attributed to the middle years of the artist's career.[3] In the 1950 catalogue raisonné, the Louvre staff curator Hélène Adhémar listed the painting as a Spring-Summer 1716 work;[4] in a 1959 study, the painter and connoisseur Jacques Mathey attributed it to c. 1714.[5] In the 1968 catalogue raisonné, the Italian art historian Ettore Camesasca dated the painting c. 1715;[6] in the 1980s, the French scholar Marianne Roland Michel suggested a ca. 1715–1716 dating.[7] In 2002, Renaud Temperini gives a slightly later dating of ca. 1716–1717.[8][9]

The Chord is an oil on panel painting, shaped as a vertical rectangle that measures 24 by 17 cm. It shows a full-length single figure of a male guitarist in a theatrical costume, seated tuning a guitar amid a landscape; the man's head, turned to the left, is barren. He wears a rose-colored coat and knee-britches slashed with yellow, embellished with blue ribbons and shoes with blue rosettes.[10][11]

The painting has often been confused with Mezzetin, a painting by Watteau held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which also depicts the same character from the Italian theatre. However, the two characters do not have the same physique at all. Another Mezzetin by Watteau is kept at the Pierpont Morgan Library.[12]

The preparatory drawing for the painting is kept in particular at the Rouen Museum of Fine Arts, other very similar drawings are kept at the Petit Palais Museum, the Louvre and formerly in the Bordeaux-Groult collection in Paris.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17495466,"Répétition du ""Joueur de flûte"" et de ""La femme de Diomède"" chez le prince Napoléon (Rehearsal of ""The Flute Player"" and ""Wife of Diomedes"" at the Place of Prince Napoléon) is a painting by French artist Gustave Boulanger. The painting's full title as given in the catalogue for the Paris Salon of 1861[1] is Répétition du ""Joueur de flûte"" et de ""la Femme de Diomède,"" chez S.A.I. le prince Napoléon, dans l’atrium de sa maison, avenue Montaigne.[2]

In 1855, Prince Napoléon, cousin of Napoleon III, decided to build a palace inspired by the villas of Pompeii, a place to keep his paintings, to throw parties, and to please his mistress, the actress Rachel, an iconic performer of ancient tragedies. The building, inspired in particular by the Villa of Diomedes at Pompeii, had rooms around an atrium open to the sky with a shallow pool below. Busts of the Bonaparte family surrounded the atrium, with a white marble statue of Napoleon I presiding in the guise of a deified Caesar. The Néo-Grec painter Jean-Léon Gérôme took part in the project by making three paintings that he considered ""perhaps the most beautiful things he ever signed.""[3]

The Pompeiian palace was inaugurated on 14 February 1860, in the presence of the Emperor and Empress, with all the guests and performers in ancient costume. Théophile Gautier was present to hear the recitation of his poem written for the occasion, La Femme de Diomède: Prologue. Then famous actors of the Théâtre-Français and the Comedie-Française performed The Flute Player, a play by Emile Augier, a friend of Gautier and the Néo-Grecs.[4]

Boulanger's Répétition théâtrale dans la maison d’un poète romain at the Salon of 1855 played a part in inspiring both  the Pompeiian palace and its inauguration with a play. Boulanger was privileged to immortalize the occasion with a work presented at the Salon of 1861, Répétition du ""Joueur de flûte"" et de la ""Femme de Diomède"" chez le prince Napoléon, which depicted not the performance itself but a rehearsal, with only writers, actors, and a Black slave present.[5]

Gautier wrote that the painting ""will preserve the memory of a charming spectacle…here are [the actors] Madeleine Brohan, Marie Favart [fr], and Got, and Samson, and Jean-Marie Geoffroy [fr]. All are ancients and moderns at the same time…M. Boulanger was able to merge, with rare spirit and a perfect fit, two apparently irreconcilable elements: the present and past, Paris and Pompeii before the eruption of Vesuvius!…rarely has an ancient pastiche been more successful.""[6]

Art historian Hélène Jagot remarks that the painting is many things at once—a pastiche (of numerous other pastiches, including history painting, historical re-enactment, and everything to do with the Pompeiian palace itself), a successful phantasmagoria, and a parody of Greek Revival art and its sources (Madeleine Brohan for example recalls the pose of the Ingres' Stratonice.)[7]


Saskia Hanselaar notes that 
despite its title and the action highlighted by Boulanger, the real stars of this work are neither the authors nor the celebrity actors, but the architecture itself. It is precisely about living the fantasy of a rediscovered Antiquity, and not of representing it through painting. This work has the force of evocation, and therefore of memory. It not only evokes Antiquity recreated [by the architects and Gérome]…but also a fantasy of time travel, and an homage to an era considered ideal, pure and primitive. Gautier himself expresses it this way: ""Modern life has come to awaken ancient life.""[8]

A hundred years after it was first shown, Anita Brookner assessed the painting this way:
There was, for me, a great reward in seeing precisely the kind of picture against which, we are always told, Manet reacted, although we rarely have an idea of what it looked like. This was La Répétition du ""Joueur de Flûte"" dans la maison romaine du prince Napoleon, dated 1861, by Gustave Boulanger, the French Alma-Tadema, and within its limits, not half bad. I particularly liked the attention meted out to the tiger-skin rug on the marble floor, the reproduction of the pink, blue, and yellow Percier and Fontaine décor, and the painstaking red key-pattern painted dizzily around the cornice. It is about time we stopped being frightened of the so-called bad pictures of the nineteenth century (they are, after all, no worse than the so-called good ones of today) and allowed ourselves to expend a little honest affection on them.[9]
The Pompeiian palace was demolished in 1891. A few photographs and Boulanger's painting are the only vestiges of its transient splendor.[10] With its synthesis of art, architecture, theatricality, re-enactment, wry humor, and royal patronage, Boulanger's Répétition du ""Joueur de flûte"" may be seen as the apotheosis of the Néo-Grec aesthetic.

The portrait was produced as a result of Raphael's friendship with Castiglione, whose ascent in courtly circles paralleled that of the artist. They were close friends by 1504, when Castiglione made his second visit to Urbino, as Raphael was gaining recognition as an artist in the humanist circle of the city's ducal court.[1] Raphael was commissioned by Guidobaldo da Montefeltro in 1505 to paint a picture for Henry VII; Castiglione traveled to England to present the finished painting to the king.[1] It is possible that Castiglione later served as a ""scholarly advisor"" for Raphael's The School of Athens, and that the depiction of Zoroaster in that fresco may be a portrait of the courtier.[1]

Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione may have had a practical and intimate purpose. Castiglione left his family behind when he went to Rome, and he wrote a poem in which he imagined his wife and son consoling themselves with the picture during his absence.[2]

The composition is pyramidal. It's one of only two Raphael's paintings on canvas (it was considered before as originally painted on a wood panel, and later transferred to canvas[3]). Copies produced in the 17th century show Castiglione's hands in full, suggesting that the picture was subsequently cut by several inches at the bottom[3] (at a later date researchers determined it has not been cut). Castiglione is seated against an earth-toned background and wears a dark doublet with a trim of squirrel fur and black ribbon; on his head is a turban topped by a notched beret.[4] The attire indicates that this was painted during the winter, likely that of 1514–1515, when Castiglione was in Rome by appointment of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro to Pope Leo X.[4] The lightest areas are the subject's face seen nearly head-on, a billow of white shirt front at his chest, and his folded hands, which are mostly cropped at the bottom edge of the canvas. Castiglione is seen as vulnerable, possessing a humane sensitivity characteristic of Raphael's later portraits.[5] The soft contours of his clothing and rounded beard express the subtlety of the subject's personality. In his The Book of the Courtier Castiglione argued on behalf of the cultivation of fine manners and dress.[5] He popularized the term sprezzatura, which translates roughly to ""nonchalant mastery"", an ideal of effortless grace befitting a man of culture. The concept eventually found its way into English literature, in the plays of Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare.[6]

The picture's elegance of execution is consistent with the attitude of the subject.[7] Art historian Lawrence Gowing noted the counter-intuitive handling of gray velvet (actually a fur) as contrary to an academic modeling of form, with the broad surfaces banked in rich darkness and the fabric shining most brightly as it turns away from the light.[7] For Gowing, ""The picture has the subtlety of baroque observation but the stillness and noble contour of classic painting at its peak.""[7] The portrait's composition and atmospheric quality suggest an homage to the Mona Lisa, which Raphael would have seen in Rome.[4] Yet the Castiglione portrait transcends questions of influence; art historian James Beck wrote that ""The Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione stands as a final solution for single male portraiture within the Renaissance style....""[8]

Notwithstanding shifts in the critical appraisal of Raphael's work, the painting has enjoyed consistent admiration from other artists.[7] Titian was strongly influenced by this portrait, and may have first viewed it in Castiglione's home in Mantua.[2][7] The Venetian master's Portrait of a Man (Tommaso Mosti?) is generally seen as owing a strong compositional debt to Raphael's painting, and also reflects Castiglione's influential advice regarding the restrained elegance of attire recommended for courtiers.[2][9][10] In 1639 Rembrandt drew a sketch of the painting while it was being auctioned in Amsterdam,[11] and subsequently referenced the composition in several self-portraits. A copy of the painting, now in the Courtauld Institute of Art, was painted by Peter Paul Rubens. Both Rembrandt's and Rubens's versions display Baroque flourish, quite different from the original painting's sober restraint.[3] In the 19th century Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres chose a frame for his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin much like that which adorned Raphael's painting, perhaps indicating Ingres's ambitions, while also underscoring the paintings' similarities of coloration and extraordinary illusionism.[12] At the turn of the 20th century Henri Matisse copied the painting, and Paul Cézanne exclaimed of Raphael's portrait: ""How well rounded the forehead is, with all the distinct planes. How well balanced the patches in the unity of the whole....""[7]

Now in the Louvre, the painting was acquired by Louis XIV in 1661 from the heirs of Cardinal Mazarin.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60346683,"Casting the Net is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Suzanne Valadon, executed in 1914. It has the dimensions of 201 by 301 cm. It is held in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Nancy.[1]

The painting was executed in 1914 and exhibited from March 1 to April 30, 1914, at the Salon des Indépendants. Valadon's son, the painter Maurice Utrillo, and her lover and model for this painting, André Utter, also exhibited there. During this exhibition, the canvas did not go unnoticed for its size and was subjected to some criticism. The Swiss writer and artist Arthur Cravan (known for scandalous outrageousness) subjected the picture and the artist herself to fierce criticism: “[she] knows all sorts of tricks well, but simplifying does not mean doing it in a simple way, old bitch!”. He was convicted of libel, and he later wrote: ""Contrary to my assertion, Madame Suzanne Valadon is virtue itself"".[2]

Valadon was infatuated with the young artist André Utter, a friend of her son who was 25 years younger than Valadon, and who became her lover. They got married in 1914, when the painting was made. It is Utter who is depicted on the canvas, as a naked man, standing in three different poses and who reproduces the same gesture in each of them. He embodies youth; the canvas emphasizes the power of the model, in the action of casting a fishing net. The net actually serves as a pretext for depicting his naked body tense with effort. In the first two positions, the man leans on his left leg. The model's athletic body further enhances the erotic nature of the composition.[3]

The canvas represents a classical composition on an academic theme and has a geometric design. This study of movement is reminiscent of the painting Dance (1910) by Henri Matisse (Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). The pink mountain and the blue lake were inspired by the artist's stay in Corsica and are also reminiscent of Paul Cézanne's tones.

The artist uses outline, clearly delineating the silhouette of the model in space, a technique previously used, among others, by Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The colors of the painting are warm and sensual.[4]

This is also the last painting where Valadon depicted a male nude. Subsequently, she became more interested in female and child nudes. Valadon was perceived as a symbol of a liberated and active woman, depicting a man as an object of desire. She breaks with the bourgeois conventions of her time by marrying a younger man and by depicting the male nude in her work.

The work was purchased from Madame Vigneron, who received it from the artist herself. The canvas was acquired by the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris in 1937, and in 1998 it was transferred to the Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy, for safekeeping.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24688838,"The Meeting on the Isle of Pheasants on 7 June 1660 was part of the process ending the Franco-Spanish War (1635–59); the Spanish princess Maria Theresa of Spain entered France for her marriage to Louis XIV of France, and said goodbye to her father Philip IV of Spain and much of the Spanish court.  This had been agreed at an earlier meeting on the island, on 7 November 1659, which saw the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees by the chief ministers. Pheasant Island lies on the river Bidasoa that is still the border between France and Spain, and the tiny island remains joint territory to this day.

Those present included, from Spain, Maria Theresa, the Count-Duque of Olivares, chief minister, as well as one of the organisers of the meeting, and the painter Diego Velázquez, who was then sixty years of age.[1][2]  Such grand meetings between reigning monarchs had become increasingly rare in the 17th century.

On the French side, there was the widowed queen Anne of Austria, sister of King Philip and mother of Louis XIV, the duke Philippe I of Orleans and Cardinal Mazarin, the chief minister.[1][2]

The meeting was later (by about 1660) depicted in a tapestry in a series on the life of Louis XIV, designed by Charles Le Brun, an example of which is in the Palace of Versailles.  Another set of copies of this  is now in the French Embassy in Madrid.[1][3]  This composition was later copied in oils by Jacques Laumosnier (Musée de Tessé, Le Mans).[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7142987,"Pasteur's portrait by Edelfelt is the best-known portrait of the French chemist Louis Pasteur. Painted by Albert Edelfelt (1854–1905) in 1885 the painting shows Pasteur in his laboratory at the rue d'Ulm, surrounded by his experimental apparatus, the innovative laboratory glassware used in the experimental methods, developed by him on the field of bacteriology in the late 19th century.[1]
Pasteur is regarded as one of the  main founders of bacteriology, and he is popularly known as the ""father of microbiology"".[2][3][4]

Albert  Edelfelt  was a Finland-Swedish painter, who lived in Paris. Edelfelt was one of the first Finnish artists to achieve international fame. He enjoyed considerable success in Paris and was one of the founders of the Realist art movement in Finland. He influenced several younger Finnish painters and helped fellow Finnish artists such as Akseli Gallen-Kallela and Gunnar Berndtson to make their breakthrough in Paris. One of his best known portraits is the painting made of Louis Pasteur depicting the scientist in his laboratory. This portrait of Louis Pasteur, by Albert Edelfelt, is a classic depiction of the pure scientist; the painting was emulated in print as well, and it adorns the cover of the first critical biography of the great chemist.  Within his lifetime, Pasteur became an heroic figure in French culture.

The painting depicts the scientist standing among his laboratory equipment, with a thoughtful face, and its theme indicates a  contemporary  subject, even if the light falling from the right is reminiscent of chiaroscuro. The painting of Louis Pasteur won him the Legion of Honour in 1886 at the exhibition at the Paris Salon.[5] 
Pasteur kept this portrait by Edelfelt in his dining room.[6]

Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization. He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of diseases, and his discoveries have saved countless lives ever since.

Innovative laboratory glassware and experimental methods were developed by Louis Pasteur among others, and contributed to the developing field of bacteriology in the late 19th century. In the 1880s, bacteriology was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter called spontaneous generation was attacked in a series of experiments carried out by Pasteur.[7] In the portrait, Pasteur is shown holding a glass bottle containing the spinal cord of a rabbit infected with rabies. This was suggested to the artist by Pasteur himself who was at the time working on a rabies vaccine.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7628395,"Study (Young Male Nude Seated Beside the Sea) (French: Jeune Homme nu assis au bord de la mer, figure d'étude) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Hippolyte Flandrin executed between 1835 and 1836. It is held in the Louvre, in Paris, and is the best-known work by the artist. 

Flandrin had won France's Prix de Rome in 1832, a bursary which provided the winner with a trip to Rome to concentrate on their vocation. There, Flandrin produced this study, which he sent back to Paris in 1837, in fulfillment of the bursary's requirements for the student to submit works in the tradition of various genres. In 1857, Napoleon III purchased the painting, which is now in the collection of Paris's[Louvre.

The painting gained attention among contemporary French art critics, and remains one of Flandrin's best-known works, despite being produced relatively early in his career. The subject is an unidentified youth, an ""ephebe"",[1] who sits nude on a rock with his arms wrapped around his legs and his head resting on his knees, eyes closed.  There is a sea in the background, and no distinguishable landmarks locate the figure. The enigmatic scene provides no explanation for the figure's pose: Théophile Gautier (1811–1872) commented that the young man could be shipwrecked on a deserted island, or be a shepherd who has lost his flock. Ultimately, any explanation for this scene is left to the imagination, leading to comparisons with Surrealist art in the twentieth century.[2]

In examining the influence of German aesthetic theory on French art, critic Elizabeth Prettejohn finds that the roundedness of form and ""flawless"" modeling of flesh would have met with Johann Joachim Winckelmann's approval as an exemplar of the beautiful. Prettejohn compares the figure's almost circular pose and sparse framing with that of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.

Vital to the painting's spread were reproductions based on an 1887 engraving by Jean-Baptiste Danguin that was commissioned by the state. As awareness of the work grew, the painting, despite argually meant to have any sexual subtext, became an icon of homosexual culture in the 20th century. Photographers Marcel Moore and Claude Cahun adopted the pose in a photograph of the lesbian Cahun, c. 1911. The painting was similarly evoked in early twentieth-century art photography by F. Holland Day and Wilhelm von Gloeden, and later by Robert Mapplethorpe.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2533791,"The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (French: Les licteurs rapportent à Brutus les corps de ses fils) is a work in oils by the French artist Jacques-Louis David. On a canvas of 146 square feet, this painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1789. The subject is the Roman leader Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic, contemplating the fate of his sons. They had conspired to overthrow the republic and restore the monarchy, and Brutus himself was compelled to order their deaths. In doing so, Brutus became the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. The painting was a bold allegory of civic virtue with immense resonance for the growing cause of republicanism. Its themes of virtue, sacrifice, and devotion to the nation sparked much controversy when it was unveiled in the politically charged era of the French Revolution.

David labored over the painting for more than two years before he considered it complete.[1] His attachment to the motif of Brutus had been evident for years before this painting, at least since the early 1780s when he was making The Oath of the Horatii (1784). This earlier work bears a distinct connection to Brutus through the themes of duty, loyalty, and virtue.[1] The oath itself was an element of the Brutus legend which David artistically transposed to the Horatii.[1] Similar license was taken with the composition of Brutus: the return of the sons' bodies is an episode not found in the accounts of Livy and Plutarch.[2]

David's enthusiasm for the republican cause, at least at this early stage, is a matter of dispute. Many historians believe his painterly inspirations were more prosaic, drawn from standard classical history lessons and lesser events of contemporary notoriety.[3] In spite of its quick apotheosis by the public, some contemporaries questioned the personal intentions of David regarding this work, and the debate remains unresolved.[4]

Like most of David's works, Brutus is on a large canvas. It measures 323 centimetres (127 in) in height and 422 centimetres (166 in) in width.[5] The style of painting is in the Neoclassical manner. Brutus sits on a klismos on the left, alone and brooding; to the right, his wife holds their two horrified daughters, the elder of which is about to faint,[6] while a servant on the far right quakes in anguish.[7]

Note Brutus' tense crossed feet in the picture, the sharp scissors that lay dead in the center of the painting, and the use of light and dark to draw a distinction between Brutus and his wife. Brutus does not even look back as his headless sons Tiberius and Titus are brought into the room.[8]

The name is frequently rendered in English as Brutus Receiving the Bodies of His Sons, among other variations, including Brutus and His Dead Sons and simply Brutus. The complete original name as presented to the Salon was much lengthier and more explicative. It too has been rendered in various forms,[9] but as translated from the small Salon guidebook (livret) offered in 1789, it reads, with poignancy in the first year of the Revolution, as: Brutus, first consul, returned to his house after having condemned his two sons who had allied themselves with the Tarquins and conspired against Roman liberty; the lictors return their bodies so that they may be entombed.[1]

The work had tremendous resonance for the time. The Revolution had already begun, and all paintings shown at the Salon had to be approved for political acceptability. David's 1788 portrait of Antoine Lavoisier had already been refused a display because the famed chemist was a potentially divisive figure, tied as he was to the Ancien Régime.[3] Out of similar caution, The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons was almost not shown because of concerns about inflaming pro-revolutionary passions. The public's insistence was too great, however, and the authorities were forced to give in.[3]

After its first exhibition, David's friend, the actor François-Joseph Talma, played the title role in Voltaire's Brutus and added in a scene in which the stage direction exactly replicated the composition of the already famous painting.[10]

Contemporaneously with David, the painter Angelica Kauffmann (1741–1807) was commissioned by Polish royalty to create a work she entitled Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death for Treason. This painting, now lost, is known only by written description and a preparatory pen and ink drawing from 1788.[11]

The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons is on permanent display in the Louvre in Paris.[5] A study in ink and chalk from 1787 is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.[12] An oil on canvas study is in the collections of Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.[13]

The painting is featured in the 1980 BBC series 100 Great Paintings.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18414562,"The Cows is a painting by Vincent van Gogh, produced in July 1890 during his stay in Doctor Gachet's home in Auvers-sur-Oise. It is based on an 1873 Paul van Ryssel etching Gachet owned of Jacob Jordaens's Study of Five Cows, exhibited in the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille.

The work is one of a series of copies of previous artist's works that Van Gogh painted towards the end of his life. Van Gogh's painting is also now held at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille.[1]

The painting was made by van Gogh during his stay in Auvers-sur-Oise, with Doctor Gachet. It is a copy, like van Gogh made many, of a study by Jacob Jordaens exhibited at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille. The painting was not copied directly, but from an etching by Doctor Gachet from 1873, signed with his artist name, Paul van Ryssel.

The painting appears in the inventory of the Gachet collection made in 1903 by the German critic Julius Meier-Graefe, which he then referred to as Les Bœufs. In 1950, the son of Doctor Gachet decided to donate it to the museum of Lille, his father's birthplace, along with the engraving that inspired it. But the donation is debated within the committee responsible for ratifying donations. It opposes the curators of the Louvre to the inspection of provincial museums which considers that the work does not sufficiently reflect the genius of van Gogh to be hosted by a provincial museum and proposes to deposit it in the reserves of the Louvre.[2] However, Paul Gachet insisted that the painting be exhibited in Lille. In 1951, it was assigned to the Louvre Museum and deposited at the Lille Museum of Fine Arts.[3] In 1954, when the painting was exhibited at the Musée de l'Orangerie, it sparked a violent controversy over its authenticity led by a passionate van Gogh lover, Louis Anfray, and widely reported by the press. As with other works in the Gachet[4] collection, it continued in the following years[5] and has not yet died out, carried in particular by Benoît Landais.[6] However, the laboratory examinations that were carried out did not reveal any clues that would make it possible to consider a fake. According to Anne Distel, it is more likely to be accepted for a minor work by van Gogh, perhaps a study for a painting he had in mind, produced in the exceptional circumstances of the end of his life in Auvers.[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3937379,"Portraits at the Stock Exchange (also known as At the Bourse) is a painting by the French artist Edgar Degas.  Completed in about 1879, the painting was already in the collection of the French banker Ernest May when it was listed in the catalogue of the fourth Impressionist exhibition that year. It may also have been shown in the next Impressionist exhibit in 1880, but it was not well known until it entered the collections of the Louvre in 1923. The canvas shows an interior corner of the open trading floor of the Paris Stock Exchange (The Paris Bourse).[1] May stands in the center of the picture wearing a top hat and pince-nez, listening to his colleague, a certain M. Bolâtre, leaning over his shoulder. They are likely discussing a document, possibly a bordereau, held aloft by a partially obscured third party.[2]

Although the owner and possible commissioner of the work was himself Jewish, art historian Linda Nochlin has interpreted the painting as an anti-Semitic depiction of Jews in Paris, due especially to the exaggerated features and postures of the subjects.[3] British art historian Richard Shone has written about the oil painting and its pastel study without mentioning anti-Semitism. In stark contrast to Nochlin, he describes the figures as having ""humdrum features."" May himself, according to Shone, is depicted as a ""seasoned figure"" whose ""expression gives nothing away.""
[4]
While anti-Semitism has a long history in France, there is little evidence of Degas holding this attitude until the time of the Dreyfus affair two decades later.

The technique of Portraits at the Stock Exchange can be more closely related to Impressionism than many of Degas's earlier works.  Evidence for this can be found in the painting's quickly applied, sketchy brushstrokes.  The psychological perspective of the painting is one of detachment, a common viewpoint in Impressionist paintings.  This painting is currently at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. A smaller, pastel sketch of the same subject can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

One of Guérin's early works, the painting treats the subject in a frank and direct way. It is a portrait of a young girl, depicted while covering her breasts with both hands. The smooth background, simplicity of the design and the use of the measured color are characteristic of the neo-classical style and of the school of Jean-Baptiste Regnault and Jacques-Louis David. The work was acquired by the Louvre in 1978.[1]

The girl's short hair is inspired by the ""Titus style model"" (French: à la Titus),[2] popular in France at the time and based on the hairstyle of the Roman era.[3] In fact, the work is one of the first paintings to depict this hairstyle.[4] The style may have taken its name from Titus Junius Brutus, son of the Roman politician Lucius Junius Brutus.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3224308,"The Marriage of the Virgin is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Perugino, although it is now sometimes attributed to his pupil Lo Spagna. It depicts the marriage between Joseph and Mary, and is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Caen, France. Initially commissioned to Pinturicchio for the recently completed cathedral of Perugia, Perugino took over the commission and finished the work around 1500–1504, probably after several periods of stasis.

A very similar composition was painted by unknown artists (sometimes attributed to Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, probable teacher of Perugino or Rocco  Zoppo, assistant of Perugino) for the church of San Girolamo in Spello in 1492. Which (if present scholarship is correct) is about ten years earlier than Perugino's and Raphael's treatments of the same subject. The composition of the earlier work does not utilize the elegant central perspective appearing in Perugino's and Raphael's more famous works. However, the figures in the foreground are very similar to both later paintings, including the unmistakable young man breaking the rod.

Later, in 1797, the picture was looted by Napoleon and was subsequently taken to Caen, Normandy. Attempts by the commune of Perugia, and the personal commitment of Antonio Canova, to retrieve the work failed.

The wide perspective of the picture, with at its centre an octagonal edifice and the aligned composition of the figures on the sides, is strongly related to the Perugino's Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter at the Sistine Chapel. The painting prominently displays the Virgin's engagement ring, which was then kept at the cathedral as a holy relic.

The Laundress (La Blanchisseuse) (also known in English as The Washerwoman) is an oil-on-panel painted by French artist Honoré Daumier in 1863. It is exhibited at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. The subject of laundresses, also known as washerwomen, was a popular one in art, especially in France.[1]

Acquired by the Louvre in 1927 and since 1986 exhibited at the Musée d'Orsay,[2] this painting has another two versions, currently housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, and at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery of Buffalo, New York.

Daumier lived on the Quai d'Anjou on the Île Saint-Louis in central Paris, and had plenty of opportunities for observing the attitudes of the washerwomen returning from the lavoir on the Seine, as they wearily climbed the stone steps, bent beneath the weight of their bundles of washing. Nevertheless, there is a strength as well as fatigue expressed in the body of this mature woman, accompanied by her child, whom there is evidently nobody to mind at home. The summary handling of the paint avoids any suggestion of anecdote and gives a monumental quality to this little picture.

As said, Daumier painted several variations on this theme: numerous replicas of them exist, some apocryphal. The Louvre-acquired work appears, according to critics, to be far the best. One of them – under the title Blanchisseuse – was exhibited by the painter at the Salon of 1861.[3]

Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe (French: [lə deʒœne syʁ lɛʁb, -ʒøn-]; The Luncheon on the Grass) – originally titled Le Bain (The Bath) – is a large oil on canvas painting by Édouard Manet created in 1862 and 1863.

It depicts a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés,[1] where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy.[2] The work is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[3] A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the Courtauld Gallery, London.[4]

The painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young dandies, sit with her. In front of them, the woman's clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a still life. In the background, yet too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream.  The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors.

Despite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 × 104.1 in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious and mythological subjects.[5] The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of Cabanel or Ingres.

A nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences' sense of propriety, though Émile Zola, a contemporary of Manet's, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the Louvre. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently from the perspective of ""analytic"" painters like Manet, who use a painting's subject as a pretext to paint.

There is much not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, how he got the idea and how and what sort of preparatory works he did.[5] Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 Francs in 1871, it remained in his possession until 1878 when Jean-Baptiste Faure, opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs.[5]

The figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe. Some[who?] assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be l'Île Saint-Ouen, which was just up the Seine from his family property in Gennevilliers. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process.[6] The female nude is thought to be Victorine Meurent, the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of Olympia. The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eugène and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor Ferdinand Leenhoff. Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet's family portrait.[5]

What many critics find shocking about this painting is the interaction, or lack thereof, between the three main subjects in the foreground and the woman bathing in the background. There are many contrasting qualities to the painting that juxtapose and distance the female nude from the other two male subjects. For example, the feminine versus the masculine, the  naked versus the clothed, and the white color palette versus the dark color palette creates a clear social difference between the men and the woman.[6] Additionally, some viewers are intrigued by the questions raised by the gaze of the nude woman. It is indeterminable whether she is challenging or accepting the viewer, looking past the viewer, engaging the viewer, or even looking at the viewer at all. This encounter identifies the gaze as a figure of the painting itself, as well as the figure object of the woman's gaze.[6]

As with the later Olympia (1863) and other works, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving The Judgment of Paris (c. 1515) after a drawing by Raphael.[7] Raphael was an artist revered by the conservative members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and his paintings were part of the teaching programme at the École des Beaux-Arts, where copies of fifty-two images from his most celebrated frescoes were permanently on display. Le Bain (an early title for Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe) was therefore, in many ways, a defiant painting. Manet was cheekily reworking Raphael, turning a mythological scene from one of the most celebrated engravings of the Renaissance into a tableau of somewhat vulgar Parisian holidaymakers.[8]

The Pastoral Concert (c. 1510) by Giorgione or Titian, Louvre, Paris, cited as an inspiration for Manet's painting

Giorgione, The Tempest (c. 1508), Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice, Italy

Antoine Watteau, La Partie Carrée, (c. 1713)

Scholars also cite two works as important precedents for Manet's painting Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe: The Pastoral Concert by Giorgione or possibly Titian (in the Louvre) and Giorgione's The Tempest, both of which are famous Renaissance paintings.[5] The Tempest, which also features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting, offers an important precedent for Manet's painting Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe.[9] Pastoral Concert even more closely resembles Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe, as it features two dressed men seated in a rural setting, with two undressed women. Pastoral Concert is in the collection of the Louvre in Paris and is likely, therefore, to have been studied by Manet.

According to Antonin Proust, he and Manet had been lounging by the Seine as they spotted a woman bathing in the river. This prompted Manet to say, ""I copied Giorgione's women, the women with musicians. It's black that painting. The ground has come through. I want to redo it and do it with a transparent atmosphere with people like those we see over there.""[10]

There may be a connection between Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe and the work of Antoine Watteau.[11] Manet's original title, Le Bain, initially drew the main attention to the woman near the water. This bathing figure alone is quite similar to the figure in Watteau's La Villageoise, as both women crouch or lean over near water, simultaneously holding up their skirts. It is possible that Manet adapted this pose, which is more clearly seen in a sketch of his, years before his creation of Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe.[11]

There were many mixed reviews and responses to Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe when it was first displayed[12] and it continues to yield a variety of responses. The initial response was characterized by its blunt rejection from the Paris Salon and subsequent display in the Salon des Refusés. Though many critiques were rooted in confusion about the piece, they were not always completely negative.[13]

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution present at that time in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park on the western outskirts of Paris. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.[14]

Though the peculiarity of the combination of one female nude with three clothed figures sparked mixed responses, the lack of interaction of the figures in addition to the lack of engagement by the nude woman provoked laughter instead of offense. Anne McCauley claimed that laughter as a response represses the sexual tension and makes the scene rather unthreatening to the viewer in the end.[13]

The Luncheon on the Grass is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.[16][17]
Zola presents a fictionalised version of the painting and the controversy surrounding it in his 1886 novel L'Œuvre (The Masterpiece).

This vertical painting belongs to a series of four works inspired by Albrecht Dürer's seminal 1514 engraving Melencolia I.[2] The National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen owns a horizontal version from the same year which presents a number of similarities. The Colmar version is accepted as a work largely painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder himself, but with a possible contribution of the 19-year-old Hans Cranach, which would account for the softness of the brushstrokes in some parts.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3527390,"Theseus Rediscovering His Father's Sword is a c.1638 painting by Nicolas Poussin and Jean Le Maire, acquired in London by Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale in 1860, moved to his château de Chantilly in 1871 and now in the Musée Condé at Chantilly.[1] The Uffizi (inv. 1004) and the Wildenstein collection hold autograph copies of the work, but X-ray examination has shown much retouching of the Chantilly version and so it is accepted as the original of the composition.

Such collaborations were common - in the 1630s Poussin only produced small private commissions, with foreground figures in his own hand and background architecture by a specialist painter such as Le Maire. The first record of the painting dates to the 19th century, when it was in the United Kingdom, passing through the hands of John Knight, Higginson and Nieuwenhuis before being acquired by the Duke of Aumale.

It shows a scene from Plutarch's Life of Theseus. Theseus's mother Aethra and Theseus himself were both born in Troezen. She had had sex with both Poseidon and the mortal Aegeus, king of Athens, in Troezen on the same night. Before leaving her in Troezen to return to Athens, Aegeus left his sandals and sword under a heavy boulder and instructed that - if Aethra's son could lift the boulder and recover the items under it - he must come to Athens to meet his father. Theseus later managed to do so without effort, as shown in the painting.

The Portrait of Isabella d'Este is a drawing (and possible painting) by Leonardo da Vinci which was executed between 1499 and 1500. It depicts Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua. During the Italian Wars of 1499–1504, the French invaded Italy which caused Leonardo to flee from Milan toward Mantua. There he had met Isabella, where she commissioned her portrait from him.[1] Whether Leonardo completed the portrait is unknown. There is evidence through letters of the time that he held a fully completed painting of her but they are vague in describing it. It is possible that the painting was lost to time or that it was in fact never completed at all. A version of the portrait in oils on canvas was found in a collection in Switzerland in 2015 but it has yet to be verified.[2]

It is owned by the Musée d’Orsay, though it is on display in the red salon at the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse.[1] Like A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, the work mimics Ingres in its use of a mirror to show the figure from several angles, a motif rarely used by Manet.

It is one of Manet's five portraits of Marguerite de Conflans, the earliest dating to 1873.[2] He asked her to sit again and again, meeting her at receptions organised by his wife, to which de Conflans came with her mother.[3]

It was first owned by Madamoiselle d'Angély, the subject's daughter, who left it to the Louvre in 1941. It entered that museum's collection officially in 1945. It was later assigned to the musée d'Orsay when that museum opened in 1986[4] - later the same year it was exchanged for Isidore Pils's The Death of a Sister of Charity from the Musée des Augustins. It was restored in 2005, enabling structural analysis of the canvas - the edges were worn but the canvas was still supple. The wooden frame seems not to be the original.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1193312,"The Card Sharp with the Ace of Diamonds is an oil-on-canvas painting produced ca.1636–1638 by the French artist Georges de La Tour. It is now in the Louvre, which bought it in 1972.[1] Though its commissioner is unknown, it is signed Georgius De La Tour fecit under the card sharp's elbow and in the shadow of the tablecloth.

The work depicts a card game in which the well-to-do young man on the right is being fleeced of his money by the other players, who both appear to be complicit in the scheme. The card sharp on the left is actually in the process of retrieving the ace of diamonds from behind his back.

The painting is one of two versions of the composition by de la Tour. The other version, known as The Cheat with the Ace of Clubs, with ""abundant variations in details of color, clothing, and accessories"" was purchased in 1981 by the Kimbell Art Foundation and is in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3208312,"The Distribution of the Eagle Standards is an 1810 oil painting by Jacques-Louis David depicting a military ceremony in 1804 that was arranged by Napoleon after his assumption of power as Emperor of the French. In the ceremony, Napoleon sought to revive the military ethos of the Roman Empire.

The full French language title of the work is Serment de l'armée fait à l'empereur après la distribution des aigles au champ de Mars, 5 décembre 1804, which translates literally as ""Oath of the army made to the emperor after the distribution of the eagles at the field of Mars, 5 December 1804"".[1]

The painting is in the collection of the Château de Versailles.[2] It is on display there in the Salle du Sacre, which also contains David's second version of his Sacre de l'empereur Napoléon.

The depicted event took place on 5 December 1804, three days after Napoleon's coronation ceremony. He distributed ""eagles"" that were based on the Roman aquila of the legions of Rome. The standards represented the regiments raised by the various departments of France, and they were intended to institute feelings of pride and loyalty among the troops, who would be the backbone of Napoleon's new regime. Napoleon gave an emotional speech in which he insisted that troops should defend the standards with their lives.

In early sketches of the painting, David included a winged figure of Nike, the goddess of victory, floating over the troops, but Napoleon objected to such an unrealistic feature. He also insisted that his wife Josephine be removed from the composition. He was preparing to divorce her, since she had failed to produce his heir.[3]

The final painting depicted the moment when Napoleon blessed the standards being held out towards him. Napoleon has his arm raised in imitation of ancient ""adlocutio"" scenes, which depict Classical heroes addressing troops. David's composition was heavily influenced by the friezes on Trajan's column.[3]

Previously attributed to the school of Giotto, Roberto Longhi attributed it to the master himself in 1948.[3][1] It probably formed a diptych with the Madonna Enthroned between the Virtues (Wildenstein Collection, New York), attributed to the Master of the Sails [it].[4] Art historians Gnudi and Salvini did not include the work in their catalogue of Giotto's works. William Suida, Pietro Toesca, and Offner attribute the work to a ""Master of the Strasbourg Crucifixion"" to which they also attribute the Berlin Crucifixion, a similar work in small format. Even today critics are uncertain about the work's attribution, although it has unambiguously been attributed to Giotto on major occasions such as the 2013 Giotto exhibition in the Louvre.[5] In any case, the work is dated to the late phase of Giotto's career, as demonstrated by the voluminous drapery, as found in both the Cappella Peruzzi [it] and Cappella Bardi [it].

The scene follows traditional iconography, with the experimental innovations of the Crucifixion in Scrovegni Chapel. The cross of Christ occupies the center of the painting, on a uniform gold ground. Grieving angels crowd around the figure of Christ, while below Mary Magdalene (wearing red) embraces the cross. Two groups stand at the sides, leaving the central section isolated. At left is a group of pious women with Mary, who is fainting. At right, there is Saint John the Baptist and a centurion, who is raising his arm. Their presence is all typical of Crucifixion iconography. 

Christ is slender, almost reedy, and far from depictions of weight found in works like the Crocifisso di Santa Maria Novella [it]. One innovation is the manner in which the figures are cut off by the borders of the painting, giving the impression of a gather of figures larger than that represented on the panel.

Traditionally attributed to the School of Raphael, the removal of 19th-century repainting and X-ray examination have shown that the hand, sleeves and chemise were later additions.[3] The most widely accepted hypothesis is that Giulio Romano painted the head, neck and bust after a design by Raphael, and that Raphael then added the hand and the sleeves, and covered the young woman's cleavage.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q742997,"Gian Giacomo Trivulzio (1440 or 1441 – December 5, 1518) was an Italian aristocrat and condottiero who held several military commands during the Italian Wars.

Trivulzio was born in Milan, where he studied, among others, with Galeazzo Maria Sforza. In 1465, he followed the latter's army in France to help King Louis XI of France. He also took part in the Milanese campaigns against Bartolomeo Colleoni and fought alongside Federico III da Montefeltro in the wars in Romagna.

In 1478, he supported the Florentines against Pope Sixtus IV's expansionism. Two years later, he acquired the castle of Mesocco. In 1483, he abandoned Ludovico Sforza and switched his allegiance to Charles VIII of France. In 1484, he defeated the Venetians at Martinengo.

In 1488, he married Beatrice d'Avalos, after his first wife (Margherita Colleoni) had died. In June the same year, he moved to southern Italy, entering the service of the Kingdom of Naples and its ruler Ferdinand of Aragon. The same year, Isabella of Aragon, daughter of Prince Alfonso and granddaughter of King Ferdinand, married Gian Galeazzo Sforza, formally Duke of Milan. In 1493, the young duke asked his father-in-law for support to regain his ducal power from his uncle, the Regent Ludovico il Moro. Ludovico then asked Charles VIII to invade Naples. Charles swept away any resistance in Italy and soon forced the Neapolitans to sign a peace treaty. The treaty was negotiated by Trivulzio, who in the meantime had been named commander-in-chief of the Neapolitan army. Impressed by Trivulzio's capabilities, Charles decided to engage him, with Ferdinand's permission, for a salary of 10,000 ducats a year.

Trivulzio marched toward France with Charles' army. When the retreating French were attacked by the League of Venice in the Battle of Fornovo (1495), he fought with the French army. On June 15, 1495, he was appointed governor of Asti and was given noble titles and territories in France. After Charles died in 1498, his successor, Louis XII, mustered a large army under Trivulzio to conquer the Duchy of Milan from Ludovico. Trivulzio took several fortified towns and forced Ludovico to abandon Milan. On 6 October 1499, he presented Louis XII with the keys of the city. Louis made him governor of Milan; he had already made him a Marshal of France on 29 September.

Trivulzio also took part in the victorious Battle of Agnadello against the Republic of Venice, and commanded contingents of the French army at Novara and (this time allied with the Venetians against the Swiss) Marignano. In 1516, he successfully defended Milan from the assault of Emperor Maximilian I.

However, the high taxes insisted on by the French, and reports about his behavior as governor caused him to fall in disgrace soon afterwards. He went to France to regain his position from King Francis I of France, but in vain. He died at Arpajon (France) in 1518.

His nephew, Teodoro Trivulzio, was also a military commander under France, and was briefly governor of Milan, Genoa and Lyon.

Trivulzio accumulated huge amounts of money, which he used in part as a patron of the arts, in particular of works by Bramantino. These include the Trivulzio Mausoleum in the Basilica of San Nazaro in Brolo, where he was buried, and the tapestries cycle of the Twelve Months,  now in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan.

Leonardo da Vinci converted his design for a large equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza to depict Trivulzio instead, but it never progressed beyond impressive drawings.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2698149,"Belisarius Begging for Alms (French: Bélisaire demandant l'aumône) is a large-format (288 × 312 cm) history painting in oil on canvas by the French artist Jacques-Louis David. It depicts the Byzantine general Belisarius, who heroically defeated the Vandals in North Africa in AD 533–534 on behalf of Justinian I, and (according to an apocryphal account probably added to his biography in the Middle Ages) was later blinded by the emperor and reduced to begging for alms on the street. David exhibited the work at the Salon of 1781 after returning from Italy and it proved a great success.

It is now in the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille.

The theme of mercy is omnipresent in the work, focusing on the three people considered most ""based"": the woman, the child and the old man who embodies the image of Mercy. The hands of these three individuals horizontally convey the idea of weakness involving need and love. The soldier, meanwhile, in the background, lifts his hands vertically to show his astonishment, with his chest forward. The three human ages represented give an idea of the glory of youth and the wreck of old age.

The same subject had already been used by Peyron in his own Belisarius receiving Hospitality from a Peasant; in contrast, only a few characters are present here and the scene is dependent on the story for dramatic effect. David shows us a fallen hero, old and blind, begging in the street with a young child when one of his former soldiers, astonished, recognises him.

The setting is Antique: sober, austere and overwhelming architecture is placed behind the depiction of harsh conditions. This shows that the artist wanted to associate Greek style with heroic themes in the context of the concerns of the artist's time. Essentially, it is through the theme of virtues borrowed from ancient times that the ""true style"", later called neo-classical, spread into art, rejecting the frivolities of the royal court of Louis XVI at the time of the French revolution. In the very composition of the work of David, however, the essence of the tableau juxtaposes several rococo ideas, and is thus not a completely neo-classical work. Nonetheless, the neo-classical perspective can still be found, especially in the ideas behind this painting: a revolutionary (David) offers a meditation on the moral heroism in adversity.

The artist returned to the subject in 1784, producing a smaller canvas with minor changes which is in the collection of the Louvre.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3202070,"Annunciation is an oil on canvas painting by Guido Reni, commissioned by Marie de Médicis and probably painted in early 1629. The first large painting by the artist to reach France,[1][2] it is now Inventory Number 521 in the Louvre Museum, displayed on the first floor in Room 12 of the Grande Galerie. Reni also produced an earlier and less-worked-up version of the work in 1621 for the church of San Pietro in Valle, Fano which is now in that town's art gallery.[3]

With the commission for the Annunciation as a first step, Marie de Medici contacted Reni via cardinal Bernardino Spada with a failed attempt to persuade him to come to Paris in order to paint the second gallery of the palais du Luxembourg, a commission initially given Rubens. Placed in a sumptuous marble and gilded wood frame on the high altar of the church of the couvent des Carmélites du faubourg Saint-Jacques in Paris, it was moved to that church's choir before 1684. 

The work was admired in 1665 by Bernini, who called it ""one of the most beautiful things to be seen, which on its own was worth half of Paris"".[4] Before the mid 17th century the work had a major influence on contemporary painters such as Laurent de La Hyre, Philippe de Champaigne, Jacques Stella and Eustache Le Sueur (all leaders of 'Atticism', a major classicising movement in French art of that time[5]) and was praised by art historians and critics such as Claude Malingre (1640),[6] Symonds (1649), Germain Brice (1684)[7]

On the French Revolution the work was seized and placed in storage at Les Petits-Augustins in September 1792 before becoming part of the initial nucleus collection of the Musée central des Arts de la République (later renamed the Louvre) that December. Several copies of the work survive, including one offered to Balaruc-les-Bains by Napoléon III and now on show in the church of Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption in that town.[8] Another copy is at the church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois de Paris in Paris.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5818528,"Oedipus and the Sphinx is a painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Originally a student work painted in 1808, it was enlarged and completed in 1827. The painting depicts Oedipus explaining the riddle of the Sphinx. An oil painting on canvas, it measures 189 x 144 cm, and is in the Louvre, which acquired it in 1878.

The painting was begun in Rome, where Ingres had arrived belatedly in 1806 after winning the Grand Prix de Rome in 1801. Working in a studio on the grounds of the Villa Medici, Ingres continued his studies and, as required of every winner of the Prix, he sent works at regular intervals to Paris so his progress could be judged. As his envoi of 1808 Ingres sent a life-size Figure of Oedipus and The Valpinçon Bather, hoping by these two paintings to demonstrate his mastery of the male and female nude.[1] The academicians were moderately critical of the treatment of light in both paintings, and considered the figures to be insufficiently idealized.[2]

Afterwards, Ingres retained the Figure of Oedipus in his studio for years. Around 1825 he decided to rework it to turn what was essentially a figure study into a more developed narrative scene.[3] He enlarged the canvas, adding 20 cm to the left edge, 31 cm to the top, and 31 cm to the right.[1] Within the expanded picture space he created a dramatic contrast between the brightly illuminated landscape seen in the distance, and the shadows that envelop the Sphinx.[1] Ingres modified the pose of the Sphinx and added the human remains seen in the lower left corner.[3] The fleeing man seen at the right, whose attitude and expression reveal Ingres's study of Poussin, was also added at this time.[3] In November 1827 Ingres exhibited the finished work, along with two portraits, in the Salon, where they were well received.[4]

The painting is signed and dated 1808 at the lower left. Ingres sold Oedipus and the Sphinx in 1829, and it entered the Louvre in 1878.[3]

A small oil sketch of ca. 1826 in which Ingres tested his composition before reworking the painting is in the National Gallery, London.[1] It was once owned by Edgar Degas, who purchased it in 1897 or earlier.[5]

In 1864 Ingres painted a third version of Oedipus and the Sphinx, smaller than the first version, which reverses the composition and varies many details. It is in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, Maryland.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2360329,"The Three Graces is an oil painting by Italian painter Raphael, housed in the Musée Condé of Chantilly, France. The date of origin has not been positively determined, though it seems to have been painted at some point after his arrival to study with Pietro Perugino in about 1500,[1] possibly 1503-1505.[2][3] According to James Patrick in 2007's Renaissance and Reformation, the painting represents the first time that Raphael had depicted the nude female form in front and back views.[3]

The image depicts three of the Graces of classical mythology. It is frequently asserted that Raphael was inspired in his painting by a ruined Roman marble statue displayed in the Piccolomini Library of the Siena Cathedral—19th-century art historian [Dan K] held that it was a not very skillful copy of that original—but other inspiration is possible, as the subject was a popular one in Italy.[1][4] Julia Cartwright in Early Work of Raphael (2006) proposes that the painting bears far more influence of the school of Ferrara than classical sculpture, making clear that the statue was not Raphael's model.[5]

The three women in the painting may represent stages of development of woman, with the girded figure on the left representing the maiden (Chastitas) and the woman to the right maturity (Voluptas), though other interpretations have certainly been advanced.[6][7]

In 1930, Professor Erwin Panofsky proposed that this painting was part of a diptych along with Vision of a Knight and that based on the theme of Vision the painting represented the Hesperides with the golden apples which Hercules stole.[8] Some art historians disagree with Panofsky's conclusion. Roger Jones and Nicholas Penny, in 1987's biography Raphael, suggest that the scale differences of the figures in the paintings make it unlikely that they were intended as a diptych, though ""one might have formed the lid of the other.""[9] In 16th Century Italian Art (2006), Michael Wayne Cole opines that while ""there can be no doubt that they form a pair...they must not be imagined as a diptych, which is excluded by their square shape and also by the change in scale of the figures.""[7] Cole presents the figures as handmaidens of Venus, holding the golden apples with which she is associated and affirming the proper connection of ""Virtus"" (presented by Vision) and Amor.[10]

Chemin de la Machine, Louveciennes or 'Route de Sèvres near Louveciennes is an 1873 painting by Alfred Sisley. Exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1900, it entered the Louvre in 1918 from the collection of Joanny Peytel, and has been in the Musée d'Orsay since 1986.

It is an oil on canvas that measures 54 × 73 cm, a large size. The clarity of the sky which accentuates the impression of cold contrasts with the brown tones of the ground which are reinforced by the oblique light.[1] The road running perpendicular to the surface of the painting gives the illusion of a three-dimensional representation. The impression of depth is reinforced by the row of trees, punctuating the trunks and their shadows with vertical and horizontal lines. The rise creates an off-center vanishing point, towards a bird's eye view of the sunny background. Like Johan Barthold Jongkind, Sisley humanizes the landscape, introducing small silhouettes.[2]

Le Chemin de la Machine, Louveciennes is reminiscent of Meindert Hobbema's The Avenue at Middelharnis (1689, London, National Gallery), which Sisley was able to see during his first stay in London. The direction of the construction may reveal the influence of Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, and the important place of the sky recalls Salomon van Ruysdael, one of the masters of the Dutch landscape of the 17th century.[1]

The Strasbourg painting has long been attributed to an anonymous Caravaggista known as Pensionante del Saraceni, although another version of the painting, which appeared on the art market in 2013, is closer to the technique of that painter, which is, in effect, ""much softer and cooler"" than Caravaggio's. The Strasbourg version, the closest to Caravaggio's own style, is supposedly based on an original that was probably painted around 1593. Earlier attributions had suggested the authorship of Mattia Preti, but this could never be substantiated.[3][1]

The Strasbourg Boy Bitten by a Crayfish had formerly belonged to the Comte de Pourtalès Collection; it was sold in Paris on 27 March 1865 but at some point in time returned to the heirs of the count De Pourtalès, for it was gifted to the museum in 1931 by Mrs. Bérard de Loÿs Chandieu, heiress of the Château de Pourtalès through her mother.[1]

Homage to Delacroix is an 1864 painting by Henri Fantin-Latour painted in homage to the French Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix who died the year before. The work features a group of painters and writers, all of whom went on to become notable themselves, gathered around a portrait of the late Delacroix. The painting was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1864. Today the painting is part of the permanent collection of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.[1][2][3]

This painting is one of the four and the first of this series that represent groups of artistic personalities of his time in the framework of manifesto paintings. It was on the occasion of Delacroix's funeral that Fantin-Latour, shocked by the thinness of the procession where he had followed in the company of Charles Baudelaire and Édouard Manet, decide to paint a public tribute in which he would represent a set of ten personalities from the French arts and letters world showing their admiration, gathered in front of a portrait of the Romantic master who had died the previous year.[4]

Besides Delacroix, pictured in the work are Louis Cordier, Louis Edmond Duranty, Alphonse Legros, Henri Fantin-Latour, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Eugène Delacroix, Champfleury, Édouard Manet, Félix Bracquemond, Charles Baudelaire, and Albert de Balleroy.[5] Whistler and Manet stand to the left and right, respectively, of the portrait of Delacroix, which was executed from a photograph taken approximately a decade earlier.[6]

The work was shown at the Paris Salon of 1864 where it obtained not very positive reviews from critics who reproach it for his static and photographic structure and the dark tones. Despite this, the painting was appreciated in the artistic environment and Fantin-Latour would successfully create other collective portraits of painters and writers of his circle in the following years, like A Studio at Les Batignolles (1870).[7]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2909916,"Bonaparte Visits the Plague Stricken in Jaffa (French: Bonaparte visitant les pestiférés de Jaffa) is an oil-on-canvas painting commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte and painted in 1804 by Antoine-Jean Gros, portraying an event during the French invasion of Egypt.[1] The scene shows Napoleon during a striking scene which is supposed to have occurred in Jaffa on 11 March 1799, depicting the French general making a visit to his ill soldiers at the Armenian Saint Nicholas Monastery. 

The commission was an attempt to embroider Bonaparte's mythology and quell reports that Napoleon had ordered fifty plague victims in Jaffa be given fatal doses of opium during his retreat from his Syrian expedition. It also served a propaganda purpose in countering reports of French atrocities during their capture of Jaffa. On 18 September 1804, the painting was exhibited at the Salon de Paris, between Napoleon's proclamation as emperor on 18 May and his coronation at Notre-Dame de Paris on 2 December. Dominique Vivant Denon, who participated in Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt and was now director of the musée du Louvre, acted as advisor to Gros on it. The painting now forms part of the collection of French paintings at the Louvre.[1]

The painting was ordered by the state after Napoleon had become emperor, and it had a clear propaganda purpose.[2] As for eyewitnesses, in General Berthier's campaign report there is no mention about such an event.[2] Bourrienne, Bonaparte's private secretary, wrote only that the general crossed the lazaretto at a fast pace.[2] However, Doctor Desgenettes (present in the painting between Napoleon and the patient with the raised arm) wrote that Bonaparte grabbed the sick and helped to transport them.[2] It is now known that the plague is not transmitted by touch.[2]

The painting was also commissioned in part to counter reports of French atrocities during their capture of Jaffa. After two French messengers sent to parley with the Ottomans had been killed and their heads displayed on the city walls, Napoleon promised the troops under his command two days and nights to plunder the city. After the city capitulated on the fourth day, the French brutally sacked the city, ""slaughtering Christians, Jews and Muslims indiscriminately."" Napoleon also ordered the mass killing of 3,000 Ottoman prisoners in French captivity.[3] News of such atrocities contradicted the French justification for their invasions of Ottoman-held Egypt and Syria, namely that it was a mission civilatrice ""that would bring enlightenment to the benighted lands of the East."" The painting ""thus had a very specific propagandist function.""[4]

This painting uses elements of the composition of Jacques-Louis David's 1784 Oath of the Horatii, also held at the Louvre, such as the three arcades from Oath, which defined three different worlds (the three sons making the oath in the left, the father brandishing the swords in the middle and the women abandoned to sadness in the right), a principle taken up in this painting as well.

It is sometimes mistaken to be set in a mosque but is actually set in the Armenian Saint Nicholas Monastery, whose courtyard can be seen in the background.[5] Further into the background are the walls of Jaffa, with a breached tower above that flies an oversized French flag. The smoke from a fire, or excessive cannon smoke, dominates the town.

To the left, dominated by a typically Egyptian horseshoe arch, a man is richly dressed in the oriental manner hands out bread and is aided by a servant carrying a bread-basket. Behind them, two black men carry a stretcher on which is a form, probably a cadaver. The two-coloured arcade opens out on a gallery full of the sick.

To the right, under two arcades, under a broken arch, is Napoleon, accompanied by his officers, touching the armpit bubo presented to him by one of the sick. In front of him, an Arab doctor is caring for another sick man, and a blind man struggles to approach the general. The bottom of the painting is occupied by prostrate and extended men. The light of the painting and the play of colours paint Bonaparte's gesture in the best possible light.

The capture and the violent sack of Jaffa by the French army under Bonaparte on 7 March 1799 were rapidly followed by an outbreak of bubonic plague, identified by January 1799, which decimated the army. On 11 March, Bonaparte made a spectacular visit to his sick soldiers and touched them,[dubious  – discuss] which was considered to be either magnificent or suicidal, according to one's point of view on the Napoleonic legend or of the terrors of an age of plagues.

The Napoleonic army requested the help of the priests from the Armenian monastery, who provided medicine that was able to cure some of the soldiers. Napoleon personally thanked the Armenian patriarch and gifted him with his own tent and sword.[citation needed]

The sick man with bandaged eyes on the right is suffering from blindness as well as plague. Since the army's arrival in Egypt in July 1798, several French had suffered serious eye problems because of the sand, dust and the extreme light of the sun.

In 1804, there was no question of representing it as other than a daring deed by Bonaparte, but the officer behind Napoleon tries to stop him touching the bubo. The means by which bubonic plague spread were still unknown in the early 19th century, and the flea's role in its transmission was unknown until Paul-Louis Simond found evidence for it in 1898. Touching a bubo with a bare hand was not particularly risky since all of the other actors in the scene are now known to be running exactly the same risk of transmission of the disease by fleas. The left-hand officer's action of holding something over his mouth and nose is not entirely unjustified, however, since certain cases of bubonic plague can evolve into a pulmonary plague, with a highly-elevated risk of infection from aerosols emitted by patients' coughs.

Medical efforts to stop the plague, seen a little further to the right, were unchanged since the Middle Ages. An old doctor is incising the bubos to let the pus flow out, which is in fact inefficient in terms of treating the disease and weakens the patient. He has already operated on a bubo under the raised right arm of his patient, who holds a bloodied compress under his arm, and is wiping his blade ready to incise a second bubo. The doctor's assistant supports the patient during the operation. The bodies are sick and languishing, and the hero is less heroic for being surrounded by ordinary people. Idealism and classicism were abandoned in favour of a certain romanticism. In effect, it is suffering in painted form, which was a novelty since previously, only noble deaths were painted.

On 23 April 1799, during the Siege of Acre, Bonaparte suggested to Desgenettes, the expedition's chief doctor, that the sick should be administered a fatal-level dose of opium. Desgenetted refused to perform euthanasia. On 27 May, Napoleon made a second visit to the plague victims.

In the context of the Troubadour style, especially while Napoleon was becoming emperor, this episode evoked the tradition of the thaumaturgical royal touch which the French kings carried out with sufferers of scrofula.

A longstanding question concerning the interpretation of the painting is the significance of the number ""32"" on the hat of one of the patients. Since Gros, the artist, was 32 years old at the time at the composition, the shy, naked prisoner behind the patient raising his arm in front of Napoleon may in fact be a hidden self-portrait. 

Alternatively, it could reflect the soldier's regiment since the 32e demi-brigade was one of the French units committed to the Egyptian campaign.

L'Origine du monde (""The Origin of the World"") is a picture painted in oil on canvas by the French artist Gustave Courbet in 1866. It is a close-up view of the vulva and abdomen of a naked woman, lying on a bed with legs spread.

Art historians had speculated for years that Courbet's model for L'Origine du monde was his favourite model, Joanna Hiffernan, also known as Jo. Her lover at the time was the American painter James Whistler, a friend of Courbet.[1]

Hiffernan was the subject of a series of four portraits by Courbet titled Jo, la belle Irlandaise (Jo, the beautiful Irishwoman) painted in 1865–66. The possibility that she was the model for L'Origine du monde[2][3] or that she was having an affair with Courbet might explain Courbet's and Whistler's brutal separation a short while later.[4] In spite of Hiffernan's red hair contrasting with the darker pubic hair of L'Origine du monde, the hypothesis that Hiffernan was the model continues. Redhead Jacky Colliss Harvey puts forward the idea that the woman's body hair suggests a more obvious candidate might be the brunette painted with Hiffernan in Courbet's Le Sommeil; and that the identification with Hiffernan has been greatly influenced by the eroticised and sexualised image of the female redhead.[5]

In February 2013, Paris Match reported that Courbet expert Jean-Jacques Fernier had authenticated a painting of a young woman's head and shoulders as the upper section of L'Origine du monde which according to some was severed from the original work. Fernier has stated that because of the conclusions reached after two years of analysis, the head will be added to the next edition of the Courbet catalogue raisonné.[2][6] The Musée d'Orsay has indicated that L'Origine du monde was not part of a larger work.[7] The Daily Telegraph reported that ""experts at the [French] art research centre CARAA (Centre d'Analyses et de Recherche en Art et Archéologie) were able to align the two paintings via grooves made by the original wooden frame and lines in the canvas itself, whose grain matched.""[2] According to CARAA, it performed pigment analyses which were identified as classical pigments of the 2nd half of the 19th century. No other conclusions were reported by the CARAA.[8] The claim reported by Paris Match was characterized as dubious by Le Monde art critic Philippe Dagen, indicating differences in style, and that canvas similarities could be caused by buying from the same shop.[9]

Documentary evidence however links the painting with Constance Quéniaux, a former dancer at the Paris Opera and a mistress of the Ottoman diplomat Halil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey) who commissioned the painting.[10] According to the historian Claude Schopp and the head of the French National Library's prints department, Sylvie Aubenas, the evidence is found in correspondence between Alexandre Dumas fils and George Sand.[11] Another potential model was Marie-Anne Detourbay, who also was a mistress of Halil Şerif Pasha.[11]

Halil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey), an Ottoman diplomat, is believed to have commissioned the work shortly after he moved to Paris. Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve introduced him to Courbet and he ordered a painting to add to his personal collection of erotic pictures, which already included Le Bain turc (The Turkish Bath) from Ingres and another painting by Courbet, Le Sommeil (The Sleepers), for which it is supposed that Hiffernan was one of the models.[10]

After Khalil Bey's finances were ruined by gambling, the painting subsequently passed through a series of private collections. It was first bought during the sale of the Khalil Bey collection in 1868, by antique dealer Antoine de la Narde. Edmond de Goncourt hit upon it in an antique shop in 1889, hidden behind a wooden pane decorated with the painting of a castle or a church in a snowy landscape. According to Robert Fernier, who published two volumes of the Courbet catalogue raisonné and founded the Musée Courbet, Hungarian collector Baron Ferenc Hatvany bought it at the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in 1910 and took it with him to Budapest. Towards the end of the Second World War the painting was looted by Soviet troops, but later ransomed by Hatvany. Hatvany left Hungary, which was on the brink of a Communist takeover, in 1947. He was allowed to take only one art work with him, and he took L'Origine to Paris.[12]

In 1955 L'Origine du monde was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs, about US$4,285 at the time.[13] Its new owner was the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. He and his wife, actress Sylvia Bataille, installed it in their country house in Guitrancourt. Lacan asked André Masson, his stepbrother, to build a double bottom frame and draw another picture thereon. Masson painted a surrealist, allusive version of L'Origine du monde.[14][15]

The New York public had the opportunity to view L'Origine du monde in 1988 during the Courbet Reconsidered show at the Brooklyn Museum; the painting was also included in the exhibition Gustave Courbet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2008. After Lacan died in 1981, the French Minister of Economy and Finances agreed to settle the family's inheritance tax bill through the transfer of the work (""Dation en paiement"" in French law) to the Musée d'Orsay; the transfer was finalized in 1995.[10]

During the 19th century, the display of the nude body underwent a revolution whose main activists were Courbet and Manet. Courbet rejected academic painting and its smooth, idealised nudes, but he also directly recriminated the hypocritical social conventions of the Second Empire, where eroticism and even pornography were acceptable in mythological or oneiric paintings.

Courbet later insisted he never lied in his paintings, and his realism pushed the limits of what was considered presentable. With L'Origine du monde, he has made even more explicit the eroticism of Manet's Olympia. Maxime Du Camp, in a harsh tirade, reported his visit to the work's purchaser, and his sight of a painting ""giving realism's last word"".[16]

By the very nature of its realistic, graphic nudity, the painting still has the power to shock and triggers censorship.

Although moral standards and resulting taboos regarding the artistic display of nudity have changed since Courbet, owing especially to photography and cinema, the painting remained provocative. Its arrival at the Musée d'Orsay caused high excitement. According to postcard sales, in 2007 L'Origine du monde was the second most popular painting in the Musée d'Orsay, after Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette.[17]

Some critics maintain that the body depicted is not (as has been argued) a lively erotic portrayal of a female but of a corpse: ""L'Origine does not represent a full female body but rather a slice of one, cut off by the frame [...]. The pallidness of the skin and the mortuary gauze surrounding the body suggest death.""[18]

The explicitness of the picture may have served as an inspiration, albeit with a satirical twist, for Marcel Duchamp's last major work, Étant donnés (1946–1966), a construction also featuring the image of a woman lying on her back with her legs spread.[19]

In 1989, French artist Orlan created the cibachrome L'origine de la guerre (The Origin of War), a male version of L'origine du monde showing a penile erection.[20]

Brazilian artist Vik Muniz created two versions of the famous painting. ""The first [1999] is a photograph made of dust or dirt, which plays with the common moralist association between female genitalia and filth. In the second piece [2013], Muniz remakes L'Origine from an assemblage of journal clippings that are reminiscent of the anatomic and artistic procedure of cutting that produced [...] the female body.""[21]

Two Origins of the World (2000) by Mexican artist Enrique Chagoya ""recycles L'Origine du monde as a spectral backdrop behind three solid black, blue and white squares of canvas in three of the corners of the painting. In the foreground of the bottom right corner, an indigenous man sits at a fourth canvas, this one on an easel, apparently 'interpreting' the Courbet painting.""[22]

In 2002, American artist Jack Daws created an homage to the painting. Entitled Origins of the World, it is a collection of various photographs of vulvas, taken from pornographic magazines, and framed in montage.[23]

The British artist Anish Kapoor created an installation in 2004 called L'Origine du monde, which references Courbet's painting. The piece is in the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa in Japan.[24]

The image is also referenced as inspiring Catherine Breillat's filming of the female genitalia in her 2004 film Anatomie de l'enfer (Anatomy of Hell).[25]

The Serbian performance artist Tanja Ostojić parodied the work in a poster in 2005, informally called the ""EU panties"" poster. Like Courbet's painting, the poster proved controversial, and was ultimately removed from the art exhibition in which it was originally displayed.[citation needed]

The French artist Bettina Rheims closes The Book of Olga (2008) with a photo of protagonist Olga Rodionova depicting L'Origine du monde almost completely. The few differences represent the evolution of tastes from the 19th to the 21st centuries: perfectly depilated genitalia with clitoral piercing jewelry and an intimate tattoo of Olga Rodionova, in comparison to natural hairy look of Constance Quéniaux.[26] The controversial book gained wide fame and became the subject of a legal fight in Russia.
On 23 February 2009 in Braga, Portugal, the police confiscated the book Pornocratie by Catherine Breillat, displayed in bookshops using L'Origine du monde as its cover.[27] A great deal of controversy was sparked by the police action. The reason given was the need to maintain public order. Also, the book title incorrectly hinted at pornographic content. Portuguese law forbids public displays of pornography.[citation needed]

In 2010, British composer Tony Hymas composed De l'origine du monde a musical suite dedicated to the picture as well as relations between Courbet and the Paris Commune, based on texts by Courbet himself, Charles Baudelaire and Pierre Dupont.[citation needed]

The German-born Turkish artist Taner Ceylan has painted a work named 1879 (From the Lost Paintings Series) (2011) in which a veiled Ottoman noblewoman stands before the framed canvas of L'Origine du monde.[28][29]

On 29 May 2014, a Luxembourg performance artist, Deborah De Robertis, sat on the floor in front of the painting and mimicked the view of the subject. This resulted in security guards closing the room and her arrest.[30][31]

US artist Candice Lin recreated L'Origine du monde in a video of her an audiovisual sculpture Hunter Moon / Inside Out (2015). In it, Courbet's L'Origine du monde with eyes ""looks back at the onlookers."" From a feminist point of view, Lin's work challenges ""the asymmetry of power [...] between those who look and those who are seen.""[32]

In February 1994, the novel Adorations perpétuelles (Perpetual Adorations) by Jacques Henric [fr] reproduced L'Origine du monde on its cover. Police visited several French bookshops to have them withdraw the book from their windows. A few proprietors maintained the book, but others complied, and some voluntarily removed it.[citation needed]

In February 2011, Facebook censored L'Origine du monde after it was posted by Copenhagen-based artist Frode Steinicke, to illustrate his comments about a television program aired on DR2. Following the incident, many other Facebook users defiantly changed their profile pictures to the Courbet painting in an act of solidarity with Steinicke. Facebook, which originally disabled Steinicke's profile, finally re-enabled it without the L'Origine du monde picture. As the case won media attention, Facebook deleted other pages about the painting.[33][34]

In October 2011, again, a complaint was lodged against Facebook with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris (Paris court of general jurisdiction) by a French Facebook user after his profile was disabled for showing a picture of L'Origine du monde. The picture was a link to a television program aired on Arte about the history of the painting. As he got no answer to his emails to Facebook, he decided to lodge a complaint for ""infringement of freedom of expression"" and against the legality of Facebook's terms which define the courts located in Santa Clara County, California, as the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all litigating claims.[35] In February 2016, the Paris court ruled that Facebook could be sued in France.[36]

In 2018 the French court ruled that Facebook had been wrong to close his account. Facebook has changed its policies to allow naked images in art works, and made a donation to a French street art association.[37][38]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2513064,"Venus and Cupid or Venus, Mars and Cupid is a c.1554 oil on canvas painting by Lambert Sustris, entering the French royal collection of Louis XIV in 1671 and now INV 1978 in the Louvre Museum, where it displayed in the Salle de la Joconde.[1][2]

The artist was then a studio assistant to Titian and draws on his master's use of colour.[3] Possibly commissioned by a member of the Fugger banking family in Augsburg (at least two of the five paintings by Sustris acquired by Louis are definitely known to have come from Augsburg).[4]

Before Louis XIV, it was probably owned Everhard Jabach, who seems to have owned all the Sustris works later acquired by Louis and may have bought an auction lot of works by the artist at a sale of the Fuggers' goods in Augsburg in 1650.[5] It was probably then bought from Jabach by superintendent Nicolas Fouquet, then sequestered from him under the guardianship of Charles Le Brun in 1662 and fully seized by the king nine years later.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17491886,"A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur (French: La Charrette, route sous la neige à Honfleur) is an oil-on-canvas snowscape painting by French impressionist Claude Monet. The painting depicts a man on a wooden cart travelling along a snow-laden road in Honfleur.[2]

A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur is one of nearly 140 snowscapes painted by Monet. It is believed to be his first completed snowscape, and is similar to other snowscapes by him such as The Road in Front of Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter, The Magpie, Snow at Argenteuil, and The Red Cape.

The painting is thought to be heavily influenced by the snowscapes of Japanese artist Utagawa Hiroshige (1797–1858), such as Ochanomizu and Clear weather after snow at Kaneyama (1797–1858).[1] Aspects such as the single vanishing point and varied colors of snow can also trace their influences back to Japan.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47351908,"The Astronomer and his Wife is a late 1640s oil painting by the Flemish artist Gonzales Coques. It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory numbers is 580.[2]

In 1899, the painting was identified by Georg Dehio as ""circle of Gonzales Coques, circa 1648"", but already in 1903, the same specialist defined its author as an ""anonymous Dutch painter, between 1660 and 1670"". This was due to the fact that, based on the supposed nature of the scientific instruments, the male person was identified as the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens. It has however been established since that the likeness with Huygens is only superficial, and that the instruments predate Huygens's own. Although some Dutch specialists have suggested that The Astronomer and his Wife may have been painted by Cornelis de Man, the attribution to Gonzales Coques himself is generally accepted since 1938. Stylistic elements do indicate a Dutch influence, Coques having stayed in the Dutch Republic between 1645 and 1648.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23922,"

Woman with a Mirror (French: La Femme au miroir) is a painting by Titian, dated to c. 1515 and now in the Musée du Louvre, in Paris.

It is known to have been in the Gonzaga family's collection in Mantua from which it was bought by Charles I of England. After Charles' execution, it was sold off and purchased by Louis XIV of France for the Palace of Versailles.

Several attempts have been made to identify the main female figure – these have included Titian's lover, Alfonso d'Este's lover Laura Dianti, or Federico Gonzaga's lover Isabella Boschetti. None of these theories fit the date ascribed to the painting through analysis of its style, which is 1512–15, when the courts of Mantua and Ferrara were first becoming interested in Titian.

Dianti was painted by Titian in a portrait of 1523. She is probably just a model who appears in other paintings[2] – the same woman with frizzy reddish blonde hair appears in a series of paintings from around the same time (including the Flora at the Uffizi, the Vanity in Munich, the Salome in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, the Violante and the Young woman in a black dress in Vienna) as well as several Madonnas and the clothed figure in Sacred and Profane Love. As happened with the 'Bella' series, it was still customary for the artist's workshop to create similar works with variations from the same studies if not from the same cartoon.

Many versions of the work are known, equal in quality to the original but not as large. The best are in the MNAC in Barcelona, the gallery of Prague Castle, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

A woman of idealized beauty overlooks a parapet and touches a bottle placed on it (which contains, perhaps, a perfume or ointment). With her right hand, she caresses her hair. A man behind her lifts a mirror to show the woman from behind and the window that illuminates the room – his presence is linked to the Renaissance Paragone debates over artistic skill. According to Paragone ideals, painting, like sculpture, should offer multiple perspectives on its subject. The man holds a second mirror, visible in profile, in which the woman gazes at herself while she dresses.

Woman with a Mirror demonstrates a harmony of color and composition typical of the young Titian, who exalted the beauty, even sensuality, of his subjects. Women of the era wore loose hair only in the intimacy of the home, which confers to the painting an erotic character that prevails over the other elements of the vanitas theme (the bottle of ointment, the play of the mirrors).

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3204226,"The Inspiration of the Poet is an oil-on-canvas in the classical style by the artist Nicolas Poussin, painted between 1629 and 1630. It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris.

The painting seems to be the one which was in the Cardinal Mazarin Collection in 1653. 

It was given to Louis XIV in 1693, together with its companion piece, A Seaport, by the French architect and gardener André Le Nôtre. It was acquired by the Louvre in 1911.[1]

The painting depicts Apollo, accompanied by infant Cupids and by one of the Muses, about to crown a poet who is writing under his inspiration. It is not known to what the painting alludes, nor what is its exact subject. Perhaps the latter was always indefinite, because the picture appears in Mazarin's inventory of 1653 as Apollo with a Muse and a Poet crowned with Laurels. Its warm colouring reveals the Titianesque strain in Poussin's work; it must have been painted during his first Roman period, at the end of the 1620s. Several other paintings of this period are related to this work: The Inspiration of Anacreon, the Parnassus, and the book frontispiece drawn by Poussin and engraved by Claude Mellan for an edition of Virgil published by the Imprimerie Royale in 1641–1642.[2]

Some critics put forward the hypothesis that the model for the Muse, often recognizable in other works of this period by Poussin, may have been Anna Dughet, whom he married in 1630 at San Lorenzo in Lucina (Rome).[3]

It is a 102*152 cm oil on canvas. [1]

The painting shows a young Bacchus discovering Ariadne on the island of Naxos, after she was abandoned by the Greek hero Theseus. 

The painting was first attributed to Louis Le Nain, yet specialists still wonder if the author may not be Mathieu Le Nain.[citation needed]

The idyll between Bacchus and Ariadne has inspired works by many artists, including Titian, Leigh Hunt and Richard Strauss who wrote the opera Ariadne auf Naxos.

It shows a vision in Zaragoza whilst James the Great was evangelising Spain.

According to Poussin's biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori, the work was produced for the town of Valenciennes, then in the Spanish Netherlands, possibly commissioned by a Spanish general as a church altarpiece, perhaps for the church of Saint-Jacques, though no precise location is known. Another biographer dates it to around 1630. It had entered the duc de Richelieu's collection by 13 October 1665, when it was admired there by Gian Lorenzo Bernini during his stay in Paris. The French king acquired it and twelve other Poussin works (including The Four Seasons) in December 1665.[1]

It appears in an inventory of works owned by Charles Le Brun until his death in 1690 in the hôtel de Gramont near the palais du Louvre. Another inventory places it at the château de Versailles from 1695 onwards and specifically in its palais du Luxembourg in 1750. It was one of the works displayed at the Louvre when it first opened in 1793 and - though it was returned to Versailles four years later - it reverted to the Louvre in 1810.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3794660,"A Cotton Office in New Orleans, also known as Interior of an Office of Cotton Buyers in New Orleans and Portraits in an Office (New Orleans), is an oil painting by Edgar Degas. Degas depicts the interior of his maternal uncle Michel Musson's cotton firm in New Orleans. Musson, Degas's brothers René and Achille, Musson's son-in-law William Bell, and other associates of Musson are shown engaged in various business and leisure activities while raw cotton rests on a table in the middle of the office.

Degas created the painting in the early part of 1873 during an extended visit with family in New Orleans. His trip coincided with the political turbulence of Reconstruction. Degas exhibited the work at the 1876 Impressionist Exhibition in Paris. Degas hoped to sell the painting to a textile manufacturer in Manchester but was unsuccessful. A Cotton Office in New Orleans was eventually sold in 1878 to the Municipal Museum in Pau, France. Degas was the only major French Impressionist to travel to the United States and paint US subjects.[1]

Edgar Degas had familial ties to Creole New Orleans. Germain Musson, Degas's maternal grandfather, was born of French descent in Port-Au-Prince. In the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution, he relocated in 1810 to New Orleans where he established himself as a cotton exporter.[2] Musson married Marie Céleste Désirée Rillieux who was from a prominent Creole family. They had five New Orleans-born children including Degas's mother, Marie-Célestine Musson, and Michel Musson. After his wife died in 1819, Germain Musson moved his family to Paris. He relocated back to New Orleans after the 1832 marriage of his daughter Marie-Célestine to Auguste Degas. When Edgar was born, Auguste arranged the purchase of a New Orleans cottage in his son's name.[3]

Edgar Degas made his first and only trip to the United States and the birthplace of his mother in the fall of 1872 at the behest of his brother René. René at the time was running a cotton brokerage in New Orleans with their other brother Achille. René had married his first cousin Estelle Musson, daughter of Michel Musson.[4] Before he left for New Orleans, Edgar was at an artistic crossroads. He was still uncertain about focusing his painting on contemporary subjects and had not yet found much success selling his art.[5]

During his stay in New Orleans, Edgar Degas resided in Michel Musson's rented mansion in the Garden District.[6] Degas lived with his uncle; René, Estelle and their family; Michel Musson's other two daughters (one of whom was married to businessman William Bell) and their families. He spent much time painting these family members, especially Estelle.[7] However, Degas expressed dissatisfaction with this work in letters to his friends Henri Rouart[8] and James Tissot.[9]

Michel Musson and his partners ran a cotton factoring firm whose office was in close proximity to Achille and René's business. William Bell and his business partner Frederick Nash Ogden worked in the cotton trade close by. Degas would spend some time each day in his brothers' office receiving and responding to mail, reading newspapers, and overhearing his brothers' and their associates' commercial conversations. Degas would write to Tissot that, in New Orleans, ""One speaks of nothing but cotton.""[10]

The production and sale of cotton was vital to the Antebellum Southern US economy. It was also inextricably linked to slavery in the United States. During the Civil War, cotton played a pivotal role in the Confederacy's diplomatic strategy. New Orleans stood at the heart of the cotton and slave trades as both the United States' most important cotton port and its largest slave market. [11][12] Despite emancipation and the end of the plantation-slave complex in 1865, newly freed black farmers were still the main labor force in cotton production and were subjected to oppressive sharecropping systems and continued political persecution during Reconstruction.

Members of the Musson and Degas families owned slaves, supported the Confederacy, and had ties to and participated in white supremacist groups during Reconstruction. Germain and Michel Musson both owned slaves.[13] Edgar Degas's mother had her dowry increased by her father's sale of a young slave girl.[3] Michel Musson, Auguste and René Degas invested in confederate bonds.[13] In 1873, Musson was briefly a supporter of the Louisiana Unification Movement, which sought interracial cooperation and public integration. However, he, René Degas, William Bell, and Bell's associate Frederick Nash Ogden, became members and leaders of the White League and would participate in the Battle of Liberty Place.[14]

Initially intending to leave New Orleans around New Year's, Edgar Degas remained in the city until around March of 1873.[15] Before his departure, Degas found a new subject to paint and wrote to Tissot, ""After having wasted time in the family trying to do portraits in the worst conditions of the day that I have ever found or imagined, I have attached myself to a fairly vigorous picture… Interiors of a Cotton Buyers Office in New Orleans… What a lot of good this absence of Paris has done in any case, my dear friend, I have made the most of it.""[16]

While it was earlier believed to have been painted on his return to France,[17] Degas finished A Cotton Office in New Orleans in America and arranged for its travel across the Atlantic.[18]

A Cotton Office in New Orleans is both a family portrait and a depiction of 19th century capitalism. Degas paints the interior of Michel Musson's cotton factoring firm, Musson, Prestidge, and Company on Carondelet Street.

Several of Degas's relatives are depicted engaged in a range of activities. Musson is seated in the foreground and is examining cotton for its quality. His legs are cropped by the lower frame and the top of his hat is surrounded by cotton. To his left is an empty chair where raw cotton rests. René Degas sits close by, reading The Daily Picauyne. Achille Degas leans against an open window to the far left. William Bell stands next to the long table in the middle, cotton in his hands as he encourages a customer to sample it himself. Other figures include Musson's business partners and associates, bookkeeping or wearing dusters while they inspect cotton.

In the middle of the painting is a ""sea of cotton"" covering a table.[19] A small tuft has fallen off, resting by William Bell's foot.[20] The shelves in the back of the office hold stacks of brown paper-wrapped cotton bale samples.[21] In the top right, there is a picture of a steamship hanging above a safe.

Art historian Michelle Foa notes that the painting alludes to the life cycle of cotton. Cotton is represented in its raw form and its transformation into textiles is suggested through the men's finished clothing along with the various papers scattered around the office.[21] The picture of the steamship evokes the transit of cotton across the Atlantic.[22]

Art historian Marilyn Brown points out that even though the production of cotton is not shown in the painting, ""Degas's Cotton Office ultimately represses, disavows, and dematerializes the oppression of black labor by transforming its white product into a commodity sold by anxious white men.""[23]

A Cotton Office in New Orleans shares similarities with Degas's paintings of ballet rehearsals. The floor in the office is sloped in a way that resembles Degas's depictions of dance floors. The men are gathered in casual yet controlled groupings while some have assumed balletic positions. The office's interior windows resemble mirrors for working the barre.[24]

A Cotton Office exhibits a link to Degas's 1872 painting Dance Class at the Opera on the rue Le Peletier as both works feature a visible empty chair. While the chair in A Cotton Office holds raw cotton, the seat in Dance Class features a white cloth, a finished textile product.[25] Degas personally collected various fabrics. He also painted textiles throughout his career ranging from the ballet outfits to the clothes seen in renderings of laundresses. It is likely that some of the fabrics in these depiction were manufactured from southern cotton.[26]

Degas painted another rendering of cotton buyers around the same time titled Cotton Merchants in New Orleans. It is an oil sketch that has compositional similarities with A Cotton Office in New Orleans. Both paintings feature a table covered in amorphous cotton, similarly dressed men wearing formal attire, a picture within a picture of a steamship, and a contrast of the men's black attire with the white cotton. However, Degas describes Cotton Merchants as ""less complicated and more spontaneous, of a better art, where people are in summer dress, white walls, a sea of cotton of the tables."" Cotton Merchants is also noted as more ""impressionistic"" with its handling of light and airier brushstrokes than the more realistic A Cotton Office.

Cotton Merchants in New Orleans is now located at the Harvard Art Museums in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[27]

A Cotton Office in New Orleans shared compositional similarities to some of Degas's ballet paintings including The Dance Class at the Opera on the rue Le Peletier.

Compared to the meticulous A Cotton Office in New Orleans, Degas's Cotton Merchants in New Orleans is a more ""impressionistic"" sketch.

Degas had originally hoped to sell his A Cotton Office in New Orleans to a certain cotton manufacturer and art collector in Manchester, England. Manchester was one of the world's largest centers for cotton manufacturing at the time. However, the Panic of 1873 and its resulting economic depression had an adverse effect on the global cotton trade and the art market in both England and France.[28] The Manchester art collector sold his entire collection of works in April of 1873.[29] In addition, Paul Durand-Ruel, who supported many of the Impressionist artists including Degas, suffered financial losses in 1874 and temporarily ceased his purchases.[28]

At the same time, Degas's family experienced a series of financial setbacks. Auguste Degas died in 1874 and left considerable outstanding debts.[30] René and Achille Degas had also suffered losses that Edgar and the rest of the family took on. There was now a greater need for Edgar to make money from selling his art.[28]

Edgar Degas showed A Cotton Office in New Orleans in 1876 at the Impressionists' second Paris exhibition. Other participating artists included Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro. Degas exhibited A Cotton Office along with 23 other works including several of his laundress and ballet paintings.[31]

A Cotton Office was singled out more than other exhibited works for critical comment and received mostly positive reviews. Some critics favored A Cotton Office to the other works of Degas and other artists in the exhibition for its relatively finished quality.[32] Critic Arthur Baigneres wrote, ""One of the most reasonable of all [Degas's] pictures, which represents cotton merchants of New Orleans, gives us faces well-modeled and drawn with care… If one judged M. Degas only on the basis of this picture, one would be truly amazed to see him in such company.""[33] Similarly, Alfred de Lostalt published in his review of the 1876 exhibition that A Cotton Office ""is also a good picture which has nothing to do with revolutionary methods.""[34] French art critic Marius Chaumelin noted that A Cotton Office offered a ""remarkably painted"" interior space and that the work ""will not disappoint those who love accurate, frankly modern painting, and who think that the expression of ordinary life and execution ought to count.""[35] However, not all the reviews praised the painting. Novelist Emile Zola wrote that ""as [Degas] completes his work, his draftsmanship becomes blurred and pathetic. He paints pictures like Portraits in an Office (New Orleans), halfway between a seascape and a plate from an illustrated journal. He has excellent artistic perspectives, but I am afraid his brush will never really be creative.""[36]

Despite its notable critical popularity, Degas failed to sell A Cotton Office in the immediate aftermath of the 1876 exhibition.[37]

The art society in Pau, France, held local art exhibitions that in 1876 and 1877 showed works by prominent artists such as Courbet, Manet, and some of the Impressionists. Degas participated in these exhibitions and was able to sell one of his works in 1876. For the 1878 exhibition, he entered A Cotton Office in New Orleans where it received mixed reviews by the local critics.[38] After the exhibition, a five-member committee appointed by the mayor of Pau decided to purchase A Cotton Office for Pau's local Museum at a price of 2,000 francs.[39]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18572249,"The Incredulity of Saint Thomas is a 1543–1547 painting by Francesco Salviati.[1] It was commissioned for the église Notre-Dame-de-Confort in Lyon by Thomas II de Gadagne (also known as Tomaso Guadagni), a Florentine counselor to Francis I of France. It is now held in the Louvre Museum and measures 275 cm by 234 cm.[2] It is signed FRANCESCO SALVIATO FLO. OPUS (S.B.D.) and the apostle shown in three-quarter-profile is a self-portrait of Salviati.[3]

Its choice of subject reflects an anti-Medici political viewpoint shared by commissioner and artist.[4][5] The work proved popular from its arrival in Lyon onwards and was copied by several artists in several media, including an engraving by Master CC.[6] Even after art history began to neglect art produced in and for Lyon, the painting was one of few such works still to be mentioned - for example, it appears in Giorgio Vasari's Lives.[7]

Marie Antoinette and Her Children, also known as Marie Antoinette of Lorraine-Habsburg, Queen of France, and Her Children[a] is an oil painting by the French artist Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, painted in 1787, and currently displayed at the Palace of Versailles.[1] Its dimensions are 275 by 216.5 cm (108.3 by 85.2 in).[2]

In July 1785, Marie Antoinette’s reputation was tarnished by the Affair of the Diamond Necklace.[3] Despite her lack of personal involvement in the affair, public opinion turned against her.[3][4] In an effort to improve public perception of the queen, later that year, Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun was commissioned by Louis XVI[1][2] to paint an official portrait depicting Marie Antoinette sympathetically.[5] The focus was to be on Marie Antoinette as a queen and, more importantly, a mother;[2] as such, the painting shows her surrounded by her children and wearing little jewellery.[3][4] To further engage the public’s sympathy, Vigée Le Brun left an empty cradle in the place of the queen’s youngest child, Sophie-Hélène-Béatrix, who died shortly before the painting was completed.[2][5]

Its first public showing was intended to be at the Salon of August 1787.[1] However, due to Marie Antoinette’s unpopularity at the time and fears that the painting would be damaged, Vigée Le Brun refused to send it.[3] Nevertheless, the administration insisted that she do so, and the painting was exhibited, with the reaction being mixed.[3]

After the Salon, until June 1789, it was exhibited in the Mars Room in the Palace of Versailles. During the French Revolution, it was stored in the national collections; since the reign of Louis Philippe I, it has been in the care of the museum of Versailles.[4]

The painting shows Marie Antoinette wearing a red velvet gown with sable lining.[5] Her younger son, the future Louis XVII, is sitting on her lap and her daughter, Marie-Thérèse, is leaning on her arm.[3] Her elder son,  Louis-Joseph, the Dauphin at the time, is near the empty cradle, intended for her younger daughter, Sophie-Béatrice, who died before the painting's completion.[5]

The painting is heavy with symbolism.[5] Its overall composition is inspired by Renaissance depictions of the Holy Family, as advised by Jacques-Louis David, a notable contemporary painter.[3][5] There are additional references more personal to Marie Antoinette, such as the Hall of Mirrors of Versailles behind her, or the dress she is wearing, which is reminiscent of one Marie Leszczyńska wore in a portrait.[5] There is also a jewellery cabinet on the right, which evokes the story of Cornelia, an ancient Roman who famously said her children were her jewels.[5] This last reference serves to emphasize Marie Antoinette’s image as a mother, placing her own children above material concerns like jewels, especially in the wake of the Diamond Necklace scandal.[3][5]

The painting is one of the most emblematic works in the Versailles collection and is considered an important national treasure; it is known to most in France as it is reproduced in history textbooks.[5]

Three Gobelin tapestry versions were produced in 1814, 1822 and 1897.[6] The first was given to Empress Elizabeth of Austria in 1868 and the third to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia. The second tapestry has been at the Élysée Palace since 1877.[6]

It was owned by Lord Wimborne and displayed at Canford Manor in the 19th century, and has been held by the Louvre in Paris since 1980. 

The work measures 89 cm × 72 cm (35 in × 28 in).  It was painted on a wooden board and transferred to canvas in the 18th century.  The artist's signature, on a cartellino to the left at the bottom of the painting, indicates the work was made in 1455 when Marco Zoppo was working in the workshop of Francesco Squarcione in Padua: ""OPERA DEL ZOPPO DI SQUARCIONE"".  A second cartellino to the right is not legible. 

The painting depicts the Virgin Mary nursing the Christ Child. Mary is standing behind a marble parapet and in front of an elaborate marble niche decorated with garlands of fruits and leaves.  She is wearing a red dress with blue cloak, and a white headcovering with a crown.  She is holds the infant Jesus up in her arms, with the baby stooping to suckle from her uncovered right breast.  On the marble ledge in front of the central pair are a pile of books and a pear, and to either sides are groups of cherubs playing musical instruments, with two cherubs reaching up to the garlands. In the background to either side are views of a landscape and a sky with scattered clouds.

The painting may have been made for the Dardini family, based in Venice but also established in Verona and Padua, whose coat of arms is depicted at each end of the parapet.  It was in the Palazzo Manfrin in the 19th century, from where it was acquired in 1868 by Sir Ivor Bertie Guest, 2nd Baronet (later 1st Baron Wimborne) and displayed at Canford Manor.  It was sold by his descendants in 1980, and acquired by the Louvre.

The painting is also known as Amor Victorious. It is on display in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France, to which it had been donated by the collectors Othon Kaufmann and François Schlageter. Its inventory number is 994-1-1,[1] or 44.994.1.1.[2]

The painting, one of the long-lived Crespi's most monumental and expressive, was painted in the early years of his mature period, although a precise dating has proved impossible. Its texture may have been inspired by Rembrandt, its subject by Caravaggio's Triumphant Cupid, although this winged young man with the helmet, the bow and arrow, and the armillary sphere behind him, also stands for the classical allegory of ingenuity (the faculty of finding clever solutions).[2][1]

The painting once hung in Palazzo Magnani, Bologna, where it was seen and described by Joshua Reynolds, around 1750 (""A young man like figure with a helmet Bows and Arrows in his hand by Spagniolo""). It was bought in Venice in 1986 by Kaufmann and Schlageter and later given to the Musée des Beaux-Arts, together with several other paintings, among which two other Crespis; a fourth Crespi had already been donated to the museum by the two men in 1987.[2]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17492880,"Founding of the Nation (建国, Kenkoku) is a 1929 oil painting by Japanese yōga artist Kawamura Kiyoo (1854–1932).[3] Based on the myth of the cave of the sun goddess from the Kojiki, the painting resides at the Musée Guimet in Paris, where it is known as Le coq blanc or The white cockerel.[1][2][4]

According to the Musée d'Orsay catalogue, the painting's principal subject is représentation animalière or the depiction of animals.[2] As suggested by the painting's Japanese name and observed in the contemporary Japanese press, the work draws heavily on Japanese mythology, in particular the episode of the sun goddess Amaterasu's withdrawal into a cave due to her brother Susanoo's improprieties, depriving the land of light.[1]

In the Kojiki version, after the assembled kami took counsel, ""the long-singing birds of eternal night"" (generally understood as a periphrasis for ""the barndoor fowl"") were enticed to crow, the mirror Yata no Kagami and string of curved jewels  Yasakani no Magatama were commissioned, divination was performed using the shoulder blade of a stag and the bough of a cherry tree from Mount Kagu, and the mirror, string of jewels, and blue and white cloth offerings were hung from an uprooted sakaki tree. Uzume then decked herself out before performing a lewd dance upon a sounding-board; the ensuing hilarity finally succeeded in provoking Amaterasu's curiosity. Opening the door to her cave, she was presented with a mirror; opening it further, she was drawn from it by her hand as well as by rope. Later a penitent Susanoo presented to her the third of the Three Sacred Treasures, the sword Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi.[1][7]

Replete with allusions to this story, Kawamura Kiyoo's painting features a mirror, magatama, sword, suzu, sakaki with blue, white, and red cloth cords, cherry blossoms, a blue-grey Sue ware footed ritual vessel adorned with a deer, and an enza or circular woven straw mat.[1][8] At its centre is a white cockerel with a brilliant scarlet crest. The cockerel that crows at dawn has obvious associations with the sun goddess; a rite at Amaterasu's great shrine at Ise Jingū sees priests crow ""like a rooster"" before entering.[9] Here it ushers in a ""golden dawn"".[1] Contemporary notices in the French press describe it as a ""Gallic cock greeting the rising sun of Japan"", a symbol of Franco-Japanese friendship.[1][note 1]

Inscribed on the back of the painting is ""Japan · Kawamura Kiyoo, aged 78 · 6th day, 4th month, Shōwa 4 (1929)"".[note 2] With Indologist and Sanskrit scholar Sylvain Lévi acting as intermediary, the painting was presented on 30 December that year to the Jeu de Paume, the museum created in 1922 out of the foreign section of the Musée du Luxembourg. In attendance at the handover ceremony at the Louvre were minister Pierre Marraud and ambassador Mineichirō Adachi, as well as Lévi who delivered the celebratory address.[1][10] Painted by Kawamura Kiyoo specially for the French museum, Lévi on his third visit to Japan had originally wanted to acquire one of Kawamura's Venetian landscapes but was persuaded otherwise by the artist.[1]

Subsequently, the painting passed from the Jeu de Paume to the Musée National d'Art Moderne, before being assigned to the Musée d'Orsay, where it was housed between 1980 and 1986, when it was deposited at the Musée Guimet.[2] In 2012/13 it returned to Japan for the exhibition ""Kawamura Kiyoo: yōga painter of the Meiji Restoration"", held at the Edo-Tokyo Museum and Shizuoka Prefectural Museum of Art.[11][note 3]

The work, commissioned in 1855 by Anatole Bartholoni to decorate a living room at his Paris hotel, represents dance in an allegorical manner. Other canvases in the set are held at the United States Embassy in Paris.[2]

The canvas was donated by Captain Peter Moore to the National Museums for the Musée d'Orsay in 1981. It was then attributed to the Musée du Louvre, which finally assigned it to the Musée d'Orsay the same year.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1282978,"Bonaparte at the Pont d’Arcole (French: Bonaparte au Pont d’Arcole) is an oil-on-canvas painting executed in 1796 by the French artist Antoine-Jean Gros. It depicts an episode during the Battle of Arcole in November 1796, with General Napoleon Bonaparte leading his troops to storm the bridge.

The painting presents a three-quarter-length image of Bonaparte, holding the flagstaff of the Armée d'Italie in his left hand and his sword in his right – on its blade is the inscription Bonaparte, Armée d'Italie. He is dressed in the dark blue trousers and tunic of a general of the First French Republic, with a gold-embroidered red collar. Beneath them he wears a white shirt and a black neckscarf. He also wears a gold-fringed tricolor cummerbund and a square-buckled belt bearing his empty scabbard. The background suggests the smoke of battle, with a few houses in the distance on the left. The land bordering the river is painted in dark tones, with a smoking cannonball still visible.

The painting was commissioned by Joséphine, who was accompanying Napoleon in his Italian Campaign. Painted in Naples in 1796. Napoleon could reportedly not sit still for extended periods of time as a model for the portrait, Joséphine solved this by allowing Napoleon to sit in her lap and embracing him for the duration required by Gros.[2] The painting passed through the collections of Napoleon himself and of Napoleon III before being sequestered after the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870. It was then reacquired by Napoleon III's wife Eugénie de Montijo in 1871, who eight years later gave it to the Louvre (now inventory number RF271). It passed to the château de Compiègne in 1901, then finally the Palace of Versailles in 1938 (inventory number MV 6314).

Diana the Huntress (French: Diane chasseresse) is an oil-on-canvas painting by an anonymous artist of the School of Fontainebleau. Painted in about 1550, it is a mythical representation of Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of King Henry II, in the guise of the goddess Diana.[1] It is in the Louvre, which acquired it in 1840.[2]

In its linear elegance the painting exemplifies the French version of the Northern Mannerist style that was introduced to France by Italian artists such as Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio in the 1530s. It is one of many works by artists of the School of Fontainebleau depicting Diane de Poitiers, who was often personified as Diana, the Roman goddess of the hunt.[1] The nude figure carries a bow and a quiver of arrows, and is accompanied by a dog. In her hair is an ornament in the shape of a crescent moon, an attribute of the goddess.[3]

The painting was previously attributed to the Italian artist Luca Penni.[4]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q738038,"The Madonna with the Blue Diadem is a painting by Raphael and his pupil Gianfrancesco Penni, and was most likely painted in Rome around 1510-1512, now at the Louvre. In the Louvre, the painting is named Virgin and Child with the Infant Saint John, also known as Virgin with the Veil or Virgin with the Blue Diadem.[1] Additional names include Virgin with the Linen,  Slumbering Child and Silence of the Holy Virgin.[2]

Legend has it that at one time the panel, split in two, was used to cover casks in Pescia. Once found, they are said to have been expertly joined.[2]  There is also a different version where the panel was split into three pieces to make a screen, which was made whole again.[3]

By the later part of the 16th century,[3] it had been in the Chateauneuf Collection, Paris[4] and descended to his heir, the Marquis de la Vallière.[3][5]
In 1620 the painting was owned by the Marquis de la Vallière, Secretary of State, as part of the La Vallière Collection in Paris.[5][6] In 1713, Prince Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, Comte de Toulouse, owned the painting and from him it passed in 1728 into the collection of the Prince de Carignan.[3][5]

From at least 1728 to 1743 it was in the possession of Victor Amadeus I, Prince of Carignan.[6]  After he died, the painting fell to his son Louis de Carignan and painter Rigauld mediated the sale in 1742 dispersed[7] to Louis XV in 1743.[3][4][5][7]

The last Raphael painting to enter the French Royal Collection, it was acquired  from the Prince of Carignan in 1742[1][7] dispersed to Louis XV in 1743.[4][7]

Although there are several artists involved, the composition is almost certainly that of Raphael. Due to the use of bright, acid colors and the porcelain-like finish, it is thought that the finishing of the composition may have been the work of one of his pupils, Giovanfrancesco Penni, and to be dated around 1518.[1]

The painting is similar to the Madonna of Loreto (Musée Condé, Chantilly), featuring the symbolic lifting of the veil.[1] The use of veil in Renaissance paintings, from the Meditations on the Life of Christ,  symbolizes the manner in which the Madonna wrapped the Child in the veil from her head at the Nativity and, prophetically, again at the Crucifixion.[8]

Here the Virgin lifts the veil over the sleeping Child, who is turned toward the audience, with her other arm around the young John the Baptist, who has a reed across his shoulder.  Both the Virgin and John are in profile.  Attached to a blue diadem, a veil that flows down her head, across her shoulders and clings to her arms. A draped tunic, belted at the waist, flowing overtop her red underdress.[6]

While the paintings has some similarity to the Madonna of Loreto, Raphael make a more dramatic statement, such as through the use of ruins[6] of the Sacchetti Villa and vineyard, near the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.[2][3]

There is also refinement in the features and limbs of the Christ child.  The child is very calm, contrasted to the expression of awe and adoration by the young John.[6]

The Virgin and Child with Saint Stephen, Saint Jerome and Saint Maurice (French: La Vierge à l' Enfant avec saint Étienne, saint Jérôme et saint Maurice), also called the Virgin with Three Saints, is a religious painting by Titian which hangs in the Louvre in Paris.[1]

The Virgin is worshipped by the saints Stephen, Jerome, and George.[2] Gronau thinks this picture may belong to the period about 1508 to 1510.[2] The Louvre dates it to between 1510 and 1525.[1] The type of the Virgin here is like the one in the Madrid Santa Conversazione and the Annunciation, Treviso.[3] Compare the Saint Stephen with the servant's head in the Salome picture of the Doria Gallery.[4] A type like the Saint Jerome is to be found in one of the Padua frescoes.[3]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3937441,"Empress Eugénie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting is an oil on canvas painting by the German artist Franz Xaver Winterhalter completed in 1855. It features depictions of the empress of France, Eugénie de Montijo, and eight of her ladies-in-waiting.[1] The painting was displayed at the Palace of Fontainebleau during the regime of Eugénie's husband, Napoleon III.[2] After Eugénie's exile to England, the painting was given to her, and later displayed in the entrance to her house at Farnborough Hill. It is currently on display at Château de Compiègne.[3]

The painting was commissioned by Empress Eugénie de Montijo to be exhibited at the painting salon of the Exposition Universelle, which opened in May. The painting was supposed to represent the sovereign in the midst of her ladies-in-waiting, who took turns around her throughout the week. They are in the number of ten when the first sketch was made by the painter. However, the seventh lady, Léonie Bugeaud de la Piconnerie d'Isly, Comtesse de Feray, resigned in January 1855, which forced the painter to completely rethink the composition of the painting in few weeks. He managed to complete it in four months with the help of his studio to be ready for the opening of the exhibition.[4]

The reception of the painting was mixed. The Parisian critics did not fail to underline the sloppy aspect of the painting and reproached him for having been apparently more interested in the details of the dresses than in the personality of her characters. On the other hand, it was met with great success by the general public as well as by the circles of the imperial court, with the painting seen as symbolizing the splendor of the new regime. It was then exhibited at the Kunstverein in Vienna in 1856. Widely distributed in the form of prints, it became the symbol of the imperial regimen.[5]

The scene, bathed in a cold, bright light, depicts Eugénie de Montijo, Empress of the French for two years, surrounded by eight ladies-in-waiting in a fictional country setting. She is represented with a crown of honeysuckle on her head and a branch of the same plant in her hand, acting as a scepter. She slightly dominates the other characters. She is facing the Grand Mistress of her household, on her right, Anne Debelle, Princess of Essling (1802-1887), wife of François Victor Massena, 3rd Duke of Rivoli. To her left stands her lady-in-waiting, Pauline van der Linden d'Hooghvorst, Duchess of Bassano (1814-1867), wife of Napoléon Maret. Below are the ladies of the palace, who followed the empress daily: on the left, Jane Thorne, baroness of Pierres (1821-1873), wife of Stéphane de Pierres and Louise Poitelon du Tarde, viscountess of Lezay-Marnésia (1826-1891), wife of Joseph-Antoine-Albert de Lezay-Marnesia; in the center, Adrienne de Villeneuve-Bargemont, countess of Montebello (1826-1870), wife of Gustave Olivier Lannes de Montebello, and on the right, Anne Eve Mortier de Trévise, marquise of Latour-Maubourg (1829-1900), wife of César de Faÿ de La Tour-Maubourg, Claire Emilie MacDonnel, Marquise de Las Marismas de Guadalquivir (1817-1905), wife of Alexandre Aguado Moreno, and behind them, standing, Nathalie de Ségur, Baroness of Malaret (1827-1910), wife of Paul Martin d'Ayguesvives, and daughter of the Countess of Ségur).[6][7]

The composition, incorporating many characters, recalls other paintings by Winterhalter, like The Decameron (1837), one of the painter's first successes. In these two paintings, the landscape forms a simple decor placed behind the characters, as on a theater stage. It was also quickly executed and still contains drips. The characters give the impression of being arranged on an inclined plane to justify the protocol order. The costumes, on the other hand, are much more detailed, with crinolines, ruffles and ruches in bright colors.[8] A rumor has retrospectively suggested that the models present in this painting had also served as models in another work by Winterhalter, a little earlier, Florinda (Royal Collection, 1852), which uses the same composition. This comparison did not fail to cause scandal because the women are represented naked in this last work.[9]

In addition to the sketch already mentioned, a drawing and a small autograph canvas made the same year are kept in private collections.[10]

Place du Chenil in Marly, Snow Effect is an 1876 oil on canvas painting by Alfred Sisley. It is now in the Musée des beaux-arts de Rouen, to which it was given by François Depeaux in 1909[1] It was painted at Marly-le-Roi and a lifesize reproduction of it is on display near the site of its creation as part of the Pays des Impressionnistes trail.[2]

Sisley had moved to Marly in 1875. The winters of 1875-1876 were exceptionally cold, with temperatures below zero and frequent snow. Sisley painted several snowy views of Marly and nearby Louveciennes.[3] Unlike Auguste Renoir, who called snow ""nature's leprosy"", Sisley enjoyed painting snowy scenes[4] Several of his works also show Japanese influence, in the case of this work particularly Snowy Night at Kambara by Hiroshige.[5]

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99476590,"The Abduction of Helen is an Italian Renaissance mythological painting by Girolamo Genga. The painting was bought in 1898 in Rome by Wilhelm von Bode for its present location, the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 490.[1][2]

The painting comes from the palace of Pandolfo Petrucci in Siena, which had been decorated in the years 1508 to 1512 with frescoes and paintings by Pinturicchio, Luca Signorelli, Domenico Beccafumi, and Genga. Measuring 156 × 186 cm (61 × 73 in), The Abduction of Helen is slightly larger than the other surviving works (125 × 135 cm, or 49 × 53 in) and had probably not hung in the same room, although the configuration of the palace's interiors, and the original locations of the artworks, are now lost and impossible to reconstruct. It is also the only tempera painting among the surviving works.[1][3]

Helen of Troy is depicted as being gently led away by prince Paris, while there is some turmoil among the ladies of her court. The temple in the background and center of the painting while the main action takes place in the foreground is reminiscent of a similar composition by Genga's master Perugino, and by Genga's colleague Raphael, among others.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3889196,"The Barbadori Altarpiece is a painting by Filippo Lippi, dated to 1438 and housed in the Louvre Museum of Paris.

Gherardo di Bartolomeo Barbadori, who died childless in 1429, left his heritage to the Captains of Orsanmichele for the realization, in the church of Santo Spirito, of a chapel dedicated to Saint Fridianus. The chapel was built in the old sacristy of the church and in 1433 it was decided to place an altarpiece there. The work was commissioned to Filippo Lippi around 1437, and a letter from Piero de' Medici to Domenico Veneziano, dated 1 April 1438, mentions the altarpiece as having not been finished yet.

The painting remained in Santo Spirito until 1810, when it was disassembled and brought to France by the Napoleonic troops. After the 1815 restoration it was not given back.

The panel follows the traditional polyptych pattern of the time only in the upper part, which has arcades and columns. Also differently from previous works, Lippi painted the Virgin as standing, and made her the central point of the composition.

The angel on the left pulling up his garment is inspired by Nanni di Banco's group of the ""Quattro Coronati"", a sculpture in a niche of Orsanmichele. Another element of innovation (introduced at the same time by Fra Angelico) was the lack of a gilded background, replaced by an architectural space with a window opening to hilly landscape, inspired to Flemish contemporary works. The shell-shaped niche in the background, a typical element of 15th century Florentine painting, and of Lippi in particular, is inspired by a niche in the Tribunale of the Mercanzie in Orsanmichele, designed by Donatello.

The kneeling saints are St. Augustine on the right and St. Fridianus on the left. On the far left is a self-portrait of Lippi, identified as the young monk behind the balustrade.[1]

The work was originally accompanied by a predella, which was returned to Florence after the fall of Napoleon and is now housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It includes three panels depicting St. Fridianus Changing the Course of the Serchio, An Angel Foretells the Virgin Mary's Death to Her, with the Arrival of the Apostles and St Augustine's Vision of the Holy Spirit.
